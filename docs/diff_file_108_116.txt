! Scene 1
! [Rousillon. The COUNT’s palace.]
! [Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in
! black]
! COUNTESS
! In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
! BERTRAM
! And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death
! anew: but I must attend his majesty’s command, to
! whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
! LAFEU
! You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
! sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
! good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
! worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
! than lack it where there is such abundance.
! COUNTESS
! What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?
! LAFEU
! He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
! practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
! finds no other advantage in the process but only the
! losing of hope by time.
! COUNTESS
! This young gentlewoman had a father, — O, that
! ‘had’! how sad a passage ‘tis! — whose skill was
! almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
! far, would have made nature immortal, and death
! should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
! king’s sake, he were living! I think it would be
! the death of the king’s disease.
! LAFEU
! How called you the man you speak of, madam?
! COUNTESS
! He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
! his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
! LAFEU
! He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
! lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
! was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
! could be set up against mortality.
! BERTRAM
! What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
! LAFEU
! A fistula, my lord.
! BERTRAM
! I heard not of it before.
! LAFEU
! I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
! the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
! COUNTESS
! His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
! overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
! her education promises; her dispositions she
! inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
! an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
! commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
! traitors too; in her they are the better for their
! simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
! LAFEU
! Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
! COUNTESS
! ‘Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
! in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
! her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
! livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
! go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
! a sorrow than have it.
! HELENA
! I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
! LAFEU
! Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
! excessive grief the enemy to the living.
! COUNTESS
! If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
! makes it soon mortal.
! BERTRAM
! Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
! LAFEU
! How understand we that?
! COUNTESS
! Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
! In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
! Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
! Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
! Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
! Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
! Under thy own life’s key: be cheque’d for silence,
! But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,
! That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
! Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
! ‘Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,
! Advise him.
! LAFEU
! He cannot want the best
! That shall attend his love.
! COUNTESS
! Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
! [Exit]
! BERTRAM
! [To HELENA]
! The best wishes that can be forged in
! your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
! to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
! LAFEU
! Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
! your father.
! [Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU]
! HELENA
! O, were that all! I think not on my father;
! And these great tears grace his remembrance more
! Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
! I have forgot him: my imagination
! Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.
! I am undone: there is no living, none,
! If Bertram be away. ‘Twere all one
! That I should love a bright particular star
! And think to wed it, he is so above me:
! In his bright radiance and collateral light
! Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
! The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
! The hind that would be mated by the lion
! Must die for love. ‘Twas pretty, though plague,
! To see him every hour; to sit and draw
! His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
! In our heart’s table; heart too capable
! Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
! But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy
! Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
! [Enter PAROLLES]
! [Aside]
! One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
! And yet I know him a notorious liar,
! Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
! Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
! That they take place, when virtue’s steely bones
! Look bleak i’ the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
! Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
! PAROLLES
! Save you, fair queen!
! HELENA
! And you, monarch!
! PAROLLES
! No.
! HELENA
! And no.
! PAROLLES
! Are you meditating on virginity?
! HELENA
! Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
! ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
! may we barricado it against him?
! PAROLLES
! Keep him out.
! HELENA
! But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
! in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
! warlike resistance.
! PAROLLES
! There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
! undermine you and blow you up.
! HELENA
! Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
! blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
! virgins might blow up men?
! PAROLLES
! Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
! blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
! the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
! is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
! preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
! increase and there was never virgin got till
! virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
! metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
! may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
! ever lost: ‘tis too cold a companion; away with ‘t!
! HELENA
! I will stand for ‘t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
! PAROLLES
! There’s little can be said in ‘t; ‘tis against the
! rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
! is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
! disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
! virginity murders itself and should be buried in
! highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
! offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
! much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
! paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
! Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
! self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
! canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
! by’t: out with ‘t! within ten year it will make
! itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
! principal itself not much the worse: away with ‘t!
! HELENA
! How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
! PAROLLES
! Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it
! likes. ‘Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
! lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with ‘t
! while ‘tis vendible; answer the time of request.
! Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
! of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
! like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
! now. Your date is better in your pie and your
! porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
! your old virginity, is like one of our French
! withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
! ‘tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
! marry, yet ‘tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
! HELENA
! Not my virginity yet … . .
! There shall your master have a thousand loves,
! A mother and a mistress and a friend,
! A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
! A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
! A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
! His humble ambition, proud humility,
! His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
! His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
! Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
! That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he —
! I know not what he shall. God send him well!
! The court’s a learning place, and he is one —
! PAROLLES
! What one, i’ faith?
! HELENA
! That I wish well. ‘Tis pity —
! PAROLLES
! What’s pity?
! HELENA
! That wishing well had not a body in’t,
! Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
! Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
  Might with effects of them follow our friends,
! And show what we alone must think, which never
! Return us thanks.
! [Enter Page]
! Page
! Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
! [Exit]
! PAROLLES
! Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
! will think of thee at court.
! HELENA
! Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
! PAROLLES
! Under Mars, I.
! HELENA
! I especially think, under Mars.
! PAROLLES
! Why under Mars?
! HELENA
! The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
! be born under Mars.
! PAROLLES
! When he was predominant.
! HELENA
! When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
! PAROLLES
! Why think you so?
! HELENA
! You go so much backward when you fight.
! PAROLLES
! That’s for advantage.
! HELENA
! So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
! but the composition that your valour and fear makes
! in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
! PAROLLES
! I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
! acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
! which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
! thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s
! counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
! thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
! thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
! thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
! none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
! and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
! [Exit]
! HELENA
! Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
! Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
! Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
! Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
! What power is it which mounts my love so high,
! That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
! The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
! To join like likes and kiss like native things.
  Impossible be strange attempts to those
! That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
! What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
! So show her merit, that did miss her love?
! The king’s disease — my project may deceive me,
! But my intents are fix’d and will not leave me.

! Scene 2
! [Paris. The KING’s palace.]
! [Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and
! divers Attendants]
! KING
! The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
! Have fought with equal fortune and continue
! A braving war.
! First Lord
! So ‘tis reported, sir.
! KING
! Nay, ‘tis most credible; we here received it
! A certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,
! With caution that the Florentine will move us
! For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
! Prejudicates the business and would seem
! To have us make denial.
! First Lord
! His love and wisdom,
! Approved so to your majesty, may plead
! For amplest credence.
! KING
! He hath arm’d our answer,
! And Florence is denied before he comes:
! Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
! The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
! To stand on either part.
! Second Lord
! It well may serve
! A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
! For breathing and exploit.
! KING
! What’s he comes here?
! [Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]
! First Lord
! It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
! Young Bertram.
! KING
! Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;
! Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
! Hath well composed thee. Thy father’s moral parts
! Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
! BERTRAM
! My thanks and duty are your majesty’s.
! KING
! I would I had that corporal soundness now,
! As when thy father and myself in friendship
! First tried our soldiership! He did look far
! Into the service of the time and was
! Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
! But on us both did haggish age steal on
! And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
! To talk of your good father. In his youth
! He had the wit which I can well observe
! To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
! Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
! Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
! So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
! Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
! His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
! Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
! Exception bid him speak, and at this time
! His tongue obey’d his hand: who were below him
! He used as creatures of another place
! And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,
! Making them proud of his humility,
! In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
! Might be a copy to these younger times;
! Which, follow’d well, would demonstrate them now
! But goers backward.
! BERTRAM
! His good remembrance, sir,
! Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
! So in approof lives not his epitaph
! As in your royal speech.
! KING
! Would I were with him! He would always say —
! Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
! He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them,
! To grow there and to bear, — ‘Let me not live,’ —
! This his good melancholy oft began,
! On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
! When it was out, — ‘Let me not live,’ quoth he,
! ‘After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
! Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
! All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
! Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
! Expire before their fashions.’ This he wish’d;
! I after him do after him wish too,
! Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
! I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
! To give some labourers room.
! Second Lord
! You are loved, sir:
! They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
! KING
! I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, count,
! Since the physician at your father’s died?
! He was much famed.
! BERTRAM
! Some six months since, my lord.
! KING
! If he were living, I would try him yet.
! Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
! With several applications; nature and sickness
! Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
! My son’s no dearer.
! BERTRAM
! Thank your majesty.
! [Exeunt. Flourish]

! “scene” 3
! Scene 3
! [Rousillon. The COUNT’s palace.]
! [Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown]
! COUNTESS
! I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
! Steward
! Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
! wish might be found in the calendar of my past
! endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
! foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
! ourselves we publish them.
! COUNTESS
! What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
! the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
! believe: ‘tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
! you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
! enough to make such knaveries yours.
! Clown
! ‘Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
! COUNTESS
! Well, sir.
! Clown
! No, madam, ‘tis not so well that I am poor, though
! many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
! your ladyship’s good will to go to the world, Isbel
! the woman and I will do as we may.
! COUNTESS
! Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
! Clown
! I do beg your good will in this case.
! COUNTESS
! In what case?
! Clown
! In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no
! heritage: and I think I shall never have the
! blessing of God till I have issue o’ my body; for
! they say barnes are blessings.
! COUNTESS
! Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
! Clown
! My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
! by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
! COUNTESS
! Is this all your worship’s reason?
! Clown
! Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
! are.
! COUNTESS
! May the world know them?
! Clown
! I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
! all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
! that I may repent.
! COUNTESS
! Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
! Clown
! I am out o’ friends, madam; and I hope to have
! friends for my wife’s sake.
! COUNTESS
! Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
! Clown
! You’re shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
! knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
! He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
! leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he’s my
! drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
! of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
! and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
! flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
! my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
! be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
! for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
! Papist, howsome’er their hearts are severed in
! religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
! horns together, like any deer i’ the herd.
! COUNTESS
! Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
! Clown
! A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
! way:
! For I the ballad will repeat,
! Which men full true shall find;
! Your marriage comes by destiny,
! Your cuckoo sings by kind.
! COUNTESS
! Get you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.
! Steward
! May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
! you: of her I am to speak.
! COUNTESS
! Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
! Helen, I mean.
! Clown
! Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
! Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
! Fond done, done fond,
! Was this King Priam’s joy?
  With that she sighed as she stood,
! With that she sighed as she stood,
! And gave this sentence then;
! Among nine bad if one be good,
! Among nine bad if one be good,
! There’s yet one good in ten.
! COUNTESS
! What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
! Clown
! One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
! o’ the song: would God would serve the world so all
! the year! we’ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
! if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a’! An we
! might have a good woman born but one every blazing
! star, or at an earthquake, ‘twould mend the lottery
! well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a’ pluck
! one.
! COUNTESS
! You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
! Clown
! That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no
! hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
! will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
! humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
! going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.
! [Exit]
! COUNTESS
! Well, now.
! Steward
! I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
! COUNTESS
! Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
! she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
! make title to as much love as she finds: there is
! more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
! her than she’ll demand.
! Steward
! Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
! she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
! to herself her own words to her own ears; she
! thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
! stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
! Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
! such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
! god, that would not extend his might, only where
! qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
! would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
! rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
! This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
! sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
! held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
! sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
! you something to know it.
! COUNTESS
! You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
! yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
! before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
! I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
! leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
! for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.
! [Exit Steward]
! [Enter HELENA]
! Even so it was with me when I was young:
! If ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn
! Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
! Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
! It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,
! Where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth:
! By our remembrances of days foregone,
! Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
! Her eye is sick on’t: I observe her now.
! HELENA
! What is your pleasure, madam?
! COUNTESS
! You know, Helen,
! I am a mother to you.
! HELENA
! Mine honourable mistress.
! COUNTESS
! Nay, a mother:
! Why not a mother? When I said ‘a mother,’
! Methought you saw a serpent: what’s in ‘mother,’
! That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
! And put you in the catalogue of those
! That were enwombed mine: ‘tis often seen
! Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
! A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
! You ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,
! Yet I express to you a mother’s care:
! God’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
! To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,
! That this distemper’d messenger of wet,
! The many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?
! Why? that you are my daughter?
! HELENA
! That I am not.
! COUNTESS
! I say, I am your mother.
! HELENA
! Pardon, madam;
! The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
! I am from humble, he from honour’d name;
! No note upon my parents, his all noble:
! My master, my dear lord he is; and I
! His servant live, and will his vassal die:
! He must not be my brother.
! COUNTESS
! Nor I your mother?
! HELENA
! You are my mother, madam; would you were, —
! So that my lord your son were not my brother, —
! Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
! I care no more for than I do for heaven,
! So I were not his sister. Can’t no other,
! But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
! COUNTESS
! Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
! God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
! So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
! My fear hath catch’d your fondness: now I see
! The mystery of your loneliness, and find
! Your salt tears’ head: now to all sense ‘tis gross
! You love my son; invention is ashamed,
! Against the proclamation of thy passion,
! To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
! But tell me then, ‘tis so; for, look thy cheeks
! Confess it, th’ one to th’ other; and thine eyes
! See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
! That in their kind they speak it: only sin
! And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
! That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?
! If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
! If it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee,
! As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
! Tell me truly.
! HELENA
! Good madam, pardon me!
! COUNTESS
! Do you love my son?
! HELENA
! Your pardon, noble mistress!
! COUNTESS
! Love you my son?
! HELENA
! Do not you love him, madam?
! COUNTESS
! Go not about; my love hath in’t a bond,
! Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
! The state of your affection; for your passions
! Have to the full appeach’d.
! HELENA
! Then, I confess,
! Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
! That before you, and next unto high heaven,
! I love your son.
! My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love:
! Be not offended; for it hurts not him
! That he is loved of me: I follow him not
! By any token of presumptuous suit;
! Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
! Yet never know how that desert should be.
! I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
! Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
! I still pour in the waters of my love
! And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
  Religious in mine error, I adore
! The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
! But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
! Let not your hate encounter with my love
! For loving where you do: but if yourself,
! Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
! Did ever in so true a flame of liking
! Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
! Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
! To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
! But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
! That seeks not to find that her search implies,
! But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!
! COUNTESS
! Had you not lately an intent, — speak truly, —
! To go to Paris?
! HELENA
! Madam, I had.
! COUNTESS
! Wherefore? tell true.
! HELENA
! I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
! You know my father left me some prescriptions
! Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
! And manifest experience had collected
! For general sovereignty; and that he will’d me
! In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,
! As notes whose faculties inclusive were
! More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
! There is a remedy, approved, set down,
  To cure the desperate languishings whereof
! The king is render’d lost.
! COUNTESS
! This was your motive
! For Paris, was it? speak.
! HELENA
! My lord your son made me to think of this;
! Else Paris and the medicine and the king
! Had from the conversation of my thoughts
! Haply been absent then.
! COUNTESS
! But think you, Helen,
! If you should tender your supposed aid,
! He would receive it? he and his physicians
! Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
! They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
! A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
! Embowell’d of their doctrine, have left off
! The danger to itself?
! HELENA
! There’s something in’t,
! More than my father’s skill, which was the greatest
! Of his profession, that his good receipt
! Shall for my legacy be sanctified
! By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
! But give me leave to try success, I’ld venture
! The well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure
! By such a day and hour.
! COUNTESS
! Dost thou believe’t?
! HELENA
! Ay, madam, knowingly.
! COUNTESS
! Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
! Means and attendants and my loving greetings
! To those of mine in court: I’ll stay at home
! And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt:
! Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
! What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

! “scene” 1
! Scene 1
! [Paris. The KING’s palace.]
! [Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended with divers young
! Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES]
! KING
! Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
! Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
! Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
! The gift doth stretch itself as ‘tis received,
! And is enough for both.
! First Lord
! ‘Tis our hope, sir,
! After well enter’d soldiers, to return
! And find your grace in health.
! KING
! No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
! Will not confess he owes the malady
! That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
! Whether I live or die, be you the sons
! Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy, —
! Those bated that inherit but the fall
! Of the last monarchy, — see that you come
! Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
! The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
! That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
! Second Lord
! Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
! KING
! Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
! They say, our French lack language to deny,
! If they demand: beware of being captives,
! Before you serve.
! Both
! Our hearts receive your warnings.
! KING
! Farewell. Come hither to me.
! [Exit, attended]
! First Lord
! O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
! PAROLLES
! ‘Tis not his fault, the spark.
! Second Lord
! O, ‘tis brave wars!
! PAROLLES
! Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
! BERTRAM
! I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
! ‘Too young’ and ‘the next year’ and ”tis too early.’
! PAROLLES
! An thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.
! BERTRAM
! I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
! Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
! Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
! But one to dance with! By heaven, I’ll steal away.
! First Lord
! There’s honour in the theft.
! PAROLLES
! Commit it, count.
! Second Lord
! I am your accessary; and so, farewell.
! BERTRAM
! I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
! First Lord
! Farewell, captain.
! Second Lord
! Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
! PAROLLES
! Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
! sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
! find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
! Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
! on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
! entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
! reports for me.
! First Lord
! We shall, noble captain.
! [Exeunt Lords]
! PAROLLES
! Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?
! BERTRAM
! Stay: the king.
! [Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire]
! PAROLLES
! [To BERTRAM]
! Use a more spacious ceremony to the
! noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
! list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
! them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
! time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
! move under the influence of the most received star;
! and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
! be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.
! BERTRAM
! And I will do so.
! PAROLLES
! Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
! [Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES]
! [Enter LAFEU]
! LAFEU
! [Kneeling]
! Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
! KING
! I’ll fee thee to stand up.
! LAFEU
! Then here’s a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
! I would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,
! And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
! KING
! I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
! And ask’d thee mercy for’t.
! LAFEU
! Good faith, across: but, my good lord ‘tis thus;
! Will you be cured of your infirmity?
! KING
! No.
! LAFEU
! O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
! Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
! My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
! That’s able to breathe life into a stone,
! Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
! With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
! Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
! To give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand,
! And write to her a love-line.
! KING
! What ‘her’ is this?
! LAFEU
! Why, Doctor She: my lord, there’s one arrived,
! If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
! If seriously I may convey my thoughts
! In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
! With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
! Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
! Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
! For that is her demand, and know her business?
! That done, laugh well at me.
! KING
! Now, good Lafeu,
! Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
  May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
! By wondering how thou took’st it.
! LAFEU
! Nay, I’ll fit you,
! And not be all day neither.
! [Exit]
! KING
! Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
! [Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA]
! LAFEU
! Nay, come your ways.
! KING
! This haste hath wings indeed.
! LAFEU
! Nay, come your ways:
! This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
! A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
! His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid’s uncle,
! That dare leave two together; fare you well.
! [Exit]
! KING
! Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
! HELENA
! Ay, my good lord.
! Gerard de Narbon was my father;
! In what he did profess, well found.
! KING
! I knew him.
! HELENA
! The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
! Knowing him is enough. On’s bed of death
! Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
! Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
! And of his old experience the oily darling,
! He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
! Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
! And hearing your high majesty is touch’d
! With that malignant cause wherein the honour
! Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,
! I come to tender it and my appliance
! With all bound humbleness.
! KING
! We thank you, maiden;
  But may not be so credulous of cure,
! When our most learned doctors leave us and
! The congregated college have concluded
! That labouring art can never ransom nature
! From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
! So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
! To prostitute our past-cure malady
! To empirics, or to dissever so
! Our great self and our credit, to esteem
! A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
! HELENA
! My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
! I will no more enforce mine office on you.
! Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
! A modest one, to bear me back a again.
! KING
! I cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful:
! Thou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give
! As one near death to those that wish him live:
! But what at full I know, thou know’st no part,
! I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
! HELENA
! What I can do can do no hurt to try,
! Since you set up your rest ‘gainst remedy.
! He that of greatest works is finisher
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
! So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
! When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
! From simple sources, and great seas have dried
! When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
! Oft expectation fails and most oft there
! Where most it promises, and oft it hits
! Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
! KING
! I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
! Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
! Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
! HELENA
! Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d:
! It is not so with Him that all things knows
! As ‘tis with us that square our guess by shows;
! But most it is presumption in us when
! The help of heaven we count the act of men.
! Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
! Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
! I am not an impostor that proclaim
! Myself against the level of mine aim;
! But know I think and think I know most sure
! My art is not past power nor you past cure.
! KING
! Are thou so confident? within what space
! Hopest thou my cure?
! HELENA
! The great’st grace lending grace
! Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
! Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
! Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
! Moist Hesperus hath quench’d his sleepy lamp,
! Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass
! Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
! What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
! Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
! KING
! Upon thy certainty and confidence
! What darest thou venture?
! HELENA
! Tax of impudence,
! A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame
! Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden’s name
! Sear’d otherwise; nay, worse — if worse — extended
! With vilest torture let my life be ended.
! KING
! Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
! His powerful sound within an organ weak:
  And what impossibility would slay
! In common sense, sense saves another way.
! Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
! Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
! Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
! That happiness and prime can happy call:
! Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
! Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
! Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
! That ministers thine own death if I die.
! HELENA
! If I break time, or flinch in property
! Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
! And well deserved: not helping, death’s my fee;
! But, if I help, what do you promise me?
! KING
! Make thy demand.
! HELENA
! But will you make it even?
! KING
! Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
! HELENA
! Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
  What husband in thy power I will command:
  Exempted be from me the arrogance
! To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
  My low and humble name to propagate
! With any branch or image of thy state;
! But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
! Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
! KING
! Here is my hand; the premises observed,
! Thy will by my performance shall be served:
! So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
! Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
  More should I question thee, and more I must,
! Though more to know could not be more to trust,
! From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
! Unquestion’d welcome and undoubted blest.
! Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
! As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

! Scene 2
! [Rousillon. The COUNT’s palace.]
! [Enter COUNTESS and Clown]
! COUNTESS
! Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
! your breeding.
! Clown
! I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
! know my business is but to the court.
! COUNTESS
! To the court! why, what place make you special,
! when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
! Clown
! Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
! may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
! a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
! has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
  such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
! court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
! men.
! COUNTESS
! Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all
! questions.
! Clown
! It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks,
! the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
! buttock, or any buttock.
! COUNTESS
! Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
! Clown
! As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
! as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib’s
! rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
! Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
! hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
! to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the
! friar’s mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
! COUNTESS
! Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
! questions?
! Clown
! From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
! will fit any question.
! COUNTESS
! It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
! must fit all demands.
! Clown
! But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
! should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
! belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
! do you no harm to learn.
! COUNTESS
! To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
! question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
! pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
! Clown
! O Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More,
! more, a hundred of them.
! COUNTESS
! Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
! Clown
! O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
! COUNTESS
! I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
! Clown
! O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.
! COUNTESS
! You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
! Clown
! O Lord, sir! spare not me.
! COUNTESS
! Do you cry, ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and
! ‘spare not me?’ Indeed your ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very
! sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
! to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.
! Clown
! I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord,
! sir!’ I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
! COUNTESS
! I play the noble housewife with the time
! To entertain’t so merrily with a fool.
! Clown
! O Lord, sir! why, there’t serves well again.
! COUNTESS
! An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
! And urge her to a present answer back:
! Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
! This is not much.
! Clown
! Not much commendation to them.
! COUNTESS
! Not much employment for you: you understand me?
! Clown
! Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
! COUNTESS
! Haste you again.

! “scene” 3
! Scene 3
! [Paris. The KING’s palace.]
! [Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]
! LAFEU
! They say miracles are past; and we have our
! philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
! things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
! we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
! into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
! ourselves to an unknown fear.
! PAROLLES
! Why, ‘tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
! shot out in our latter times.
! BERTRAM
! And so ‘tis.
! LAFEU
! To be relinquish’d of the artists, —
! PAROLLES
! So I say.
! LAFEU
! Both of Galen and Paracelsus.
! PAROLLES
! So I say.
! LAFEU
! Of all the learned and authentic fellows, —
! PAROLLES
! Right; so I say.
! LAFEU
! That gave him out incurable, —
! PAROLLES
! Why, there ‘tis; so say I too.
! LAFEU
! Not to be helped, —
! PAROLLES
! Right; as ‘twere, a man assured of a —
! LAFEU
! Uncertain life, and sure death.
! PAROLLES
! Just, you say well; so would I have said.
! LAFEU
! I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.
! PAROLLES
! It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
! shall read it in — what do you call there?
! LAFEU
! A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.
! PAROLLES
! That’s it; I would have said the very same.
! LAFEU
! Why, your dolphin is not lustier: ‘fore me,
! I speak in respect —
! PAROLLES
! Nay, ‘tis strange, ‘tis very strange, that is the
! brief and the tedious of it; and he’s of a most
! facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the —
! LAFEU
! Very hand of heaven.
! PAROLLES
! Ay, so I say.
! LAFEU
! In a most weak —
! [pausing]
! and debile minister, great power, great
! transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
! further use to be made than alone the recovery of
! the king, as to be —
! [pausing]
! generally thankful.
! PAROLLES
! I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.
! [Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire]
! LAFEU
! Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I’ll like a maid the
! better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he’s
! able to lead her a coranto.
! PAROLLES
! Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?
! LAFEU
! ‘Fore God, I think so.
! KING
! Go, call before me all the lords in court.
! Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side;
! And with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense
! Thou hast repeal’d, a second time receive
! The confirmation of my promised gift,
  Which but attends thy naming.
! [Enter three or four Lords]
! Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
! Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
! O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice
! I have to use: thy frank election make;
! Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
! HELENA
! To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
! Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!
! LAFEU
! I’ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
! My mouth no more were broken than these boys’,
! And writ as little beard.
! KING
! Peruse them well:
! Not one of those but had a noble father.
! HELENA
! Gentlemen,
! Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.
! All
! We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
! HELENA
! I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
! That I protest I simply am a maid.
! Please it your majesty, I have done already:
! The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
! ‘We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
! Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
! We’ll ne’er come there again.’
! KING
! Make choice; and, see,
! Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
! HELENA
! Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
! And to imperial Love, that god most high,
! Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
! First Lord
! And grant it.
! HELENA
! Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
! LAFEU
! I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
! for my life.
! HELENA
! The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
! Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
! Love make your fortunes twenty times above
! Her that so wishes and her humble love!
! Second Lord
! No better, if you please.
! HELENA
! My wish receive,
! Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.
! LAFEU
! Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
! I’d have them whipped; or I would send them to the
! Turk, to make eunuchs of.
! HELENA
! Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
! I’ll never do you wrong for your own sake:
! Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
! Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
! LAFEU
! These boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her:
! sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
! ne’er got ‘em.
! HELENA
! You are too young, too happy, and too good,
! To make yourself a son out of my blood.
! Fourth Lord
! Fair one, I think not so.
! LAFEU
! There’s one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
! wine: but if thou be’st not an ass, I am a youth
! of fourteen; I have known thee already.
! HELENA
! [To BERTRAM]
! I dare not say I take you; but I give
! Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
! Into your guiding power. This is the man.
! KING
! Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.
! BERTRAM
! My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
! In such a business give me leave to use
! The help of mine own eyes.
! KING
! Know’st thou not, Bertram,
! What she has done for me?
! BERTRAM
! Yes, my good lord;
! But never hope to know why I should marry her.
! KING
! Thou know’st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
! BERTRAM
! But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
! Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
! She had her breeding at my father’s charge.
! A poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain
! Rather corrupt me ever!
! KING
! ‘Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which
! I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
! Of colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,
! Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
! In differences so mighty. If she be
! All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
! A poor physician’s daughter, thou dislikest
! Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
! From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
! The place is dignified by the doer’s deed:
! Where great additions swell’s, and virtue none,
! It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
! Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
! The property by what it is should go,
! Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
! In these to nature she’s immediate heir,
! And these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn,
! Which challenges itself as honour’s born
! And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
! When rather from our acts we them derive
! Than our foregoers: the mere word’s a slave
! Debosh’d on every tomb, on every grave
! A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
! Where dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb
! Of honour’d bones indeed. What should be said?
! If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
! I can create the rest: virtue and she
! Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
! BERTRAM
! I cannot love her, nor will strive to do’t.
! KING
! Thou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
! HELENA
! That you are well restored, my lord, I’m glad:
! Let the rest go.
! KING
! My honour’s at the stake; which to defeat,
! I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
! Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
! That dost in vile misprision shackle up
! My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
! We, poising us in her defective scale,
! Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
! It is in us to plant thine honour where
! We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
! Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
! Believe not thy disdain, but presently
! Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
! Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
! Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
! Into the staggers and the careless lapse
! Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
! Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
! Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
! BERTRAM
! Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
! My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
! What great creation and what dole of honour
! Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
! Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
! The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
! Is as ‘twere born so.
! KING
! Take her by the hand,
  And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
! A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
! A balance more replete.
! BERTRAM
! I take her hand.
! KING
! Good fortune and the favour of the king
! Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
! Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
! And be perform’d to-night: the solemn feast
! Shall more attend upon the coming space,
! Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
! Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.

! LAFEU
! [Advancing]
! Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.
! PAROLLES
! Your pleasure, sir?
! LAFEU
! Your lord and master did well to make his
! recantation.
! PAROLLES
! Recantation! My lord! my master!
! LAFEU
! Ay; is it not a language I speak?
! PAROLLES
! A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
! bloody succeeding. My master!
! LAFEU
! Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
! PAROLLES
! To any count, to all counts, to what is man.
! LAFEU
! To what is count’s man: count’s master is of
! another style.
! PAROLLES
! You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.
! LAFEU
! I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
! title age cannot bring thee.
! PAROLLES
! What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
! LAFEU
! I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
! wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
! travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
! bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
! believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
! have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
! not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
! that thou’t scarce worth.
! PAROLLES
! Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee, —
! LAFEU
! Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
! hasten thy trial; which if — Lord have mercy on thee
! for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
! well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
! through thee. Give me thy hand.
! PAROLLES
! My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
! LAFEU
! Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
! PAROLLES
! I have not, my lord, deserved it.
! LAFEU
! Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
! bate thee a scruple.
! PAROLLES
! Well, I shall be wiser.
! LAFEU
! Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
! a smack o’ the contrary. If ever thou be’st bound
! in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
! to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
! my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
! that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
! PAROLLES
! My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
! LAFEU
! I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
! doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
! thee, in what motion age will give me leave.
! [Exit]
! PAROLLES
! Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
! me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
! be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
! I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
! any convenience, an he were double and double a
! lord. I’ll have no more pity of his age than I
! would of — I’ll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
! [Re-enter LAFEU]
! LAFEU
! Sirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news
! for you: you have a new mistress.
! PAROLLES
! I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
! some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
! lord: whom I serve above is my master.
! LAFEU
! Who? God?
! PAROLLES
! Ay, sir.
! LAFEU
! The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou
! garter up thy arms o’ this fashion? dost make hose of
! sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
! thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
! honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’ld beat
! thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
! every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
! created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
! PAROLLES
! This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
! LAFEU
! Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
! kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
! no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
! and honourable personages than the commission of your
! birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
! worth another word, else I’ld call you knave. I leave you.
! [Exit]
! PAROLLES
! Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
! let it be concealed awhile.
! [Re-enter BERTRAM]
! BERTRAM
! Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
! PAROLLES
! What’s the matter, sweet-heart?
! BERTRAM
! Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
! I will not bed her.
! PAROLLES
! What, what, sweet-heart?
! BERTRAM
! O my Parolles, they have married me!
! I’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
! PAROLLES
! France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
! The tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!
! BERTRAM
! There’s letters from my mother: what the import is,
! I know not yet.
! PAROLLES
! Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
! He wears his honour in a box unseen,
! That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
! Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
! Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
! Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions
! France is a stable; we that dwell in’t jades;
! Therefore, to the war!
! BERTRAM
! It shall be so: I’ll send her to my house,
  Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
! And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
! That which I durst not speak; his present gift
! Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
! Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
! To the dark house and the detested wife.
! PAROLLES
! Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?
! BERTRAM
! Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
! I’ll send her straight away: to-morrow
! I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
! PAROLLES
! Why, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ‘Tis hard:
! A young man married is a man that’s marr’d:
! Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
! The king has done you wrong: but, hush, ‘tis so.

! If she be very well, what does she ail, that she’s

! Clown
! Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.

! [Enter PAROLLES]
! PAROLLES
! Bless you, my fortunate lady!
! HELENA
! I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own

! PAROLLES
! You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them

! Clown
! So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
! I would she did as you say.
! PAROLLES
! Why, I say nothing.
! Clown
! Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s
! tongue shakes out his master’s undoing: to say
! nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
! nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
! is within a very little of nothing.
! PAROLLES
! Away! thou’rt a knave.
! Clown
! You should have said, sir, before a knave thou’rt a
! knave; that’s, before me thou’rt a knave: this had
! been truth, sir.
! PAROLLES
! Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
! Clown
! Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
! taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
! and much fool may you find in you, even to the

! PAROLLES
! A good knave, i’ faith, and well fed.
! Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
! A very serious business calls on him.
! The great prerogative and rite of love,
! Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;

! Whose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets,

! What’s his will else?
! PAROLLES
! That you will take your instant leave o’ the king
! And make this haste as your own good proceeding,

! BERTRAM
! Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
! LAFEU
! You have it from his own deliverance.
! BERTRAM
! And by other warranted testimony.
! LAFEU
! Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
! BERTRAM
! I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in

! LAFEU
! I have then sinned against his experience and
! transgressed against his valour; and my state that

! [Enter PAROLLES]

! BERTRAM
! [Aside to PAROLLES]
! Is she gone to the king?
! PAROLLES
! She is.
! BERTRAM
! Will she away to-night?
! PAROLLES
! As you’ll have her.
! BERTRAM
! I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,

! LAFEU
! A good traveller is something at the latter end of a

! BERTRAM
! Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
! PAROLLES
! I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord’s

! BERTRAM
! It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
! LAFEU
! And shall do so ever, though I took him at ‘s

! of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
! soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in

! tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
! I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
! deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.
! [Exit]
! PAROLLES
! An idle lord. I swear.
! BERTRAM
! I think so.

! Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
! [Enter HELENA]
! HELENA
! I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,

! For present parting; only he desires

! BERTRAM
! I shall obey his will.
! You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,

! On my particular. Prepared I was not
! For such a business; therefore am I found
! So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
! That presently you take our way for home;
! And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
! For my respects are better than they seem
! And my appointments have in them a need
! Greater than shows itself at the first view

! Pray, sir, your pardon.
! BERTRAM
! Well, what would you say?
! HELENA
! I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,

! First Lord
! Holy seems the quarrel

! Therefore we marvel much our cousin France

! Clown
! By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very

! COUNTESS
! By what observance, I pray you?
! Clown
! Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the

! melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
! COUNTESS
! Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
! [Opening a letter]
! Clown
! I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our

! Clown
! E’en that you have there.
! [Exit]
! COUNTESS
! [Reads]
! I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath

! before the report come. If there be breadth enough
! in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
! to you. Your unfortunate son,
! BERTRAM.
! This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
! To fly the favours of so good a king;
! To pluck his indignation on thy head
! By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
! For the contempt of empire.
! [Re-enter Clown]
! Clown
! O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two

! COUNTESS
! What is the matter?
! Clown
! Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some

! COUNTESS
! Why should he be killed?
! Clown
! So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
! the danger is in standing to’t; that’s the loss of

! Do not say so.
! COUNTESS
! Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
! I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
! That the first face of neither, on the start,
! Can woman me unto’t: where is my son, I pray you?
! Second Gentleman
! Madam, he’s gone to serve the duke of Florence:
! We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
! And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
! Thither we bend again.
! HELENA
! Look on his letter, madam; here’s my passport.
! [Reads]
! When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
! never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
! of thy body that I am father to, then call me
! husband: but in such a ‘then’ I write a ‘never.’
! This is a dreadful sentence.
! COUNTESS
! Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
! First Gentleman
! Ay, madam;
! And for the contents’ sake are sorry for our pain.
! COUNTESS
! I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
! If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
! Thou robb’st me of a moiety: he was my son;
  But I do wash his name out of my blood,
! And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
! Second Gentleman
! Ay, madam.
! COUNTESS
! And to be a soldier?
! Second Gentleman
! Such is his noble purpose; and believe ‘t,
! The duke will lay upon him all the honour
! That good convenience claims.
! COUNTESS
! Return you thither?
! First Gentleman
! Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
! HELENA
! [Reads]
! Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
! ‘Tis bitter.
! COUNTESS
! Find you that there?
! HELENA
! Ay, madam.
! First Gentleman
! ‘Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
! heart was not consenting to.
! COUNTESS
! Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
! There’s nothing here that is too good for him
! But only she; and she deserves a lord
! That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
! And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
! First Gentleman
! A servant only, and a gentleman
! Which I have sometime known.
! COUNTESS
! Parolles, was it not?
! First Gentleman
! Ay, my good lady, he.
! COUNTESS
! A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
! My son corrupts a well-derived nature
! With his inducement.
! First Gentleman
! Indeed, good lady,
! The fellow has a deal of that too much,
! Which holds him much to have.
! COUNTESS
! You’re welcome, gentlemen.
! I will entreat you, when you see my son,
! To tell him that his sword can never win
! The honour that he loses: more I’ll entreat you
! Written to bear along.
! Second Gentleman
! We serve you, madam,

! Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
! Will you draw near!

! Those tender limbs of thine to the event
! Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
! That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
! Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
! Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
! That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
! Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
! That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
! Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
! Whoever charges on his forward breast,
! I am the caitiff that do hold him to’t;
! And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
! His death was so effected: better ‘twere
! I met the ravin lion when he roar’d
! With sharp constraint of hunger; better ‘twere
  That all the miseries which nature owes
! Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
! Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
! As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
! My being here it is that holds thee hence:
! Shall I stay here to do’t? no, no, although
! The air of paradise did fan the house
! And angels officed all: I will be gone,
! That pitiful rumour may report my flight,

! [Tucket]
! We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
! way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
! MARIANA
! Come, let’s return again, and suffice ourselves with
! the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
! French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
! no legacy is so rich as honesty.
! Widow
! I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
! by a gentleman his companion.
! MARIANA
! I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
! filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
! young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
! enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
! lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
! hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
! example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
! maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
! but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
! them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
! I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
! though there were no further danger known but the
! modesty which is so lost.
! DIANA
! You shall not need to fear me.
! Widow
! I hope so.
! [Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim]
! Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
! my house; thither they send one another: I’ll
! question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?
! HELENA
! To Saint Jaques le Grand.
! Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
! Widow
! At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
! HELENA
! Is this the way?
! Widow
! Ay, marry, is’t.
! [A march afar]
! Hark you! they come this way.
! If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
! But till the troops come by,
! I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
! The rather, for I think I know your hostess
! As ample as myself.
! HELENA
! Is it yourself?
! Widow
! If you shall please so, pilgrim.
! HELENA
! I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
! Widow
! You came, I think, from France?
! HELENA
! I did so.
! Widow
! Here you shall see a countryman of yours
! That has done worthy service.
! HELENA
! His name, I pray you.
! DIANA
! The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
! HELENA
! But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
! His face I know not.
! DIANA
! Whatsome’er he is,
! He’s bravely taken here. He stole from France,
! As ‘tis reported, for the king had married him
! Against his liking: think you it is so?
! HELENA
! Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
! DIANA
! There is a gentleman that serves the count
! Reports but coarsely of her.
! HELENA
! What’s his name?
! DIANA
! Monsieur Parolles.
! HELENA
! O, I believe with him,
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
! Of the great count himself, she is too mean
! To have her name repeated: all her deserving
! Is a reserved honesty, and that
! I have not heard examined.
! DIANA
! Alas, poor lady!
  ‘Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
! Of a detesting lord.
! Widow
! I warrant, good creature, wheresoe’er she is,
! Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
! A shrewd turn, if she pleased.
! HELENA
! How do you mean?
! May be the amorous count solicits her
! In the unlawful purpose.
! Widow
! He does indeed;
! And brokes with all that can in such a suit
! Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
! But she is arm’d for him and keeps her guard
  In honestest defence.
! MARIANA
! The gods forbid else!
! Widow
! So, now they come:
! [Drum and Colours]
! [Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army]
! That is Antonio, the duke’s eldest son;
! That, Escalus.
! HELENA
! Which is the Frenchman?
! DIANA
! He;
! That with the plume: ‘tis a most gallant fellow.
! I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
! He were much goodlier: is’t not a handsome gentleman?
! HELENA
! I like him well.
! DIANA
! ‘Tis pity he is not honest: yond’s that same knave
! That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
! I would Poison that vile rascal.
! HELENA
! Which is he?
! DIANA
! That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
! HELENA
! Perchance he’s hurt i’ the battle.
! PAROLLES
! Lose our drum! well.
! MARIANA
! He’s shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
! Widow
! Marry, hang you!
! MARIANA
! And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
! [Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army]
! Widow
! The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
! Where you shall host: of enjoin’d penitents
! There’s four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
! Already at my house.
! HELENA
! I humbly thank you:
! Please it this matron and this gentle maid
! To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
! Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
! I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
! Worthy the note.
! BOTH
! We’ll take your offer kindly.

! Scene 6
! [Camp before Florence.]
! [Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords]
! Second Lord
! Nay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his
! way.
! First Lord
! If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
! more in your respect.
! Second Lord
! On my life, my lord, a bubble.
! BERTRAM
! Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
! Second Lord
! Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
! without any malice, but to speak of him as my
! kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and
! endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
! of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s
! entertainment.
! First Lord
! It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
! his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
! great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
! BERTRAM
! I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
! First Lord
! None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
! which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
! Second Lord
! I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
! surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
! knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
! him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
! is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
! we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
! present at his examination: if he do not, for the
! promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
! base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
! intelligence in his power against you, and that with
! the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
! trust my judgment in any thing.
! First Lord
! O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
! he says he has a stratagem for’t: when your
! lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t, and to
! what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
! melted, if you give him not John Drum’s
! entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
! Here he comes.
! [Enter PAROLLES]
! Second Lord
! [Aside to BERTRAM]
! O, for the love of laughter,
! hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
! off his drum in any hand.
! BERTRAM
! How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
! disposition.
! First Lord
! A pox on’t, let it go; ‘tis but a drum.
! PAROLLES
! ‘But a drum’! is’t ‘but a drum’? A drum so lost!
! There was excellent command, — to charge in with our
! horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
! First Lord
! That was not to be blamed in the command of the
! service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
! himself could not have prevented, if he had been
! there to command.
! BERTRAM
! Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
! dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
! not to be recovered.
! PAROLLES
! It might have been recovered.
! BERTRAM
! It might; but it is not now.
! PAROLLES
! It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
! service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
! performer, I would have that drum or another, or
! ‘hic jacet.’
! BERTRAM
! Why, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur: if you
! think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
! instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
! be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
! grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
! speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
! and extend to you what further becomes his
! greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
! worthiness.
! PAROLLES
! By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
! BERTRAM
! But you must not now slumber in it.
! PAROLLES
! I’ll about it this evening: and I will presently
! pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
! certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
! and by midnight look to hear further from me.
! BERTRAM
! May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
! PAROLLES
! I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
! the attempt I vow.
! BERTRAM
! I know thou’rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
! thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
! PAROLLES
! I love not many words.
! [Exit]
! Second Lord
! No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
! strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
! to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
! be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
! damned than to do’t?
! First Lord
! You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
! is that he will steal himself into a man’s favour and
! for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
! when you find him out, you have him ever after.
! BERTRAM
! Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
! this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
! Second Lord
! None in the world; but return with an invention and
! clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
! have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
! to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect.
! First Lord
! We’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
! him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
! when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
! sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
! very night.
! Second Lord
! I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
! BERTRAM
! Your brother he shall go along with me.
! Second Lord
! As’t please your lordship: I’ll leave you.
! [Exit]
! BERTRAM
! Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
! The lass I spoke of.
! First Lord
! But you say she’s honest.
! BERTRAM
! That’s all the fault: I spoke with her but once
! And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
! By this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind,
! Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
! And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature:
  Will you go see her?
! First Lord
! With all my heart, my lord.

! [Florence. The Widow’s house.]
! [Enter HELENA and Widow]
! HELENA
! If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
  I know not how I shall assure you further,
! But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
! Widow
! Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
! Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
  And would not put my reputation now
! In any staining act.
! HELENA
! Nor would I wish you.
! First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
! And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
! Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
! By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
! Err in bestowing it.
! Widow
! I should believe you:
! For you have show’d me that which well approves
! You’re great in fortune.
! HELENA
! Take this purse of gold,
! And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
! Which I will over-pay and pay again
! When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
! Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
! Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
! As we’ll direct her how ‘tis best to bear it.
! Now his important blood will nought deny
! That she’ll demand: a ring the county wears,
  That downward hath succeeded in his house
! From son to son, some four or five descents
! Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
! In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
! To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
! Howe’er repented after.
! Widow
! Now I see
! The bottom of your purpose.
! HELENA
! You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
! But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
! Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
! In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
! Herself most chastely absent: after this,
! To marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns
! To what is passed already.
! Widow
! I have yielded:
! Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
! That time and place with this deceit so lawful
! May prove coherent. Every night he comes
! With musics of all sorts and songs composed
! To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
! To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
! As if his life lay on’t.
! HELENA
! Why then to-night
! Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
! Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
! And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
! Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
  But let’s about it.

! [Without the Florentine camp.]
! [Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush]
! Second Lord
! He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
! When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
! language you will: though you understand it not
! yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
! understand him, unless some one among us whom we
! must produce for an interpreter.
! First Soldier
! Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
! Second Lord
! Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
! First Soldier
! No, sir, I warrant you.
! Second Lord
! But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
! First Soldier
! E’en such as you speak to me.
! Second Lord
! He must think us some band of strangers i’ the
! adversary’s entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
! all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
! one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
! speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
! know straight our purpose: choughs’ language,
! gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
! interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
! ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
! and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
! [Enter PAROLLES]
! PAROLLES
! Ten o’clock: within these three hours ‘twill be
! time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
! done? It must be a very plausive invention that
! carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
! have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
! my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
! fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
! daring the reports of my tongue.
! Second Lord
! This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue
! was guilty of.
! PAROLLES
! What the devil should move me to undertake the
! recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
  impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
! must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
! exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
! will say, ‘Came you off with so little?’ and great
! ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what’s the
! instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
! butter-woman’s mouth and buy myself another of
! Bajazet’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
! Second Lord
! Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
! that he is?
! PAROLLES
! I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
! turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
! Second Lord
! We cannot afford you so.
! PAROLLES
! Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
! stratagem.
! Second Lord
! ‘Twould not do.
! PAROLLES
! Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
! Second Lord
! Hardly serve.
! PAROLLES
! Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
! Second Lord
! How deep?
! PAROLLES
! Thirty fathom.
! Second Lord
! Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
! PAROLLES
! I would I had any drum of the enemy’s: I would swear
! I recovered it.
! Second Lord
! You shall hear one anon.
! PAROLLES
! A drum now of the enemy’s, —

! [They seize and blindfold him]
! First Soldier
! Boskos thromuldo boskos.
! PAROLLES
! I know you are the Muskos’ regiment:
! And I shall lose my life for want of language;
! If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
! Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I’ll
! Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
! First Soldier
! Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak

! First Soldier
! The general is content to spare thee yet;
! And, hoodwink’d as thou art, will lead thee on
! To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
! Something to save thy life.
! PAROLLES
! O, let me live!
! And all the secrets of our camp I’ll show,

! Which you will wonder at.

! But wilt thou faithfully?

! Acordo linta.
! Come on; thou art granted space.

! [Florence. The Widow’s house.]
! [Enter BERTRAM and DIANA]
! BERTRAM
! They told me that your name was Fontibell.
! DIANA
! No, my good lord, Diana.
! BERTRAM
! Titled goddess;
! And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
! In your fine frame hath love no quality?
! If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
! You are no maiden, but a monument:
! When you are dead, you should be such a one
! As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
  And now you should be as your mother was
! When your sweet self was got.
! DIANA
! She then was honest.
! BERTRAM
! So should you be.
! DIANA
! No:
! My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
! As you owe to your wife.
! BERTRAM
! No more o’ that;
! I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
! I was compell’d to her; but I love thee
! By love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever
! Do thee all rights of service.
! DIANA
! Ay, so you serve us
! Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
! You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
! And mock us with our bareness.
! BERTRAM
! How have I sworn!
! DIANA
! ‘Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
! But the plain single vow that is vow’d true.
! What is not holy, that we swear not by,
! But take the High’st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
! If I should swear by God’s great attributes,
! I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
! When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
! To swear by him whom I protest to love,
! That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
! Are words and poor conditions, but unseal’d,
! At least in my opinion.
! BERTRAM
! Change it, change it;
! Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
! And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts
! That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
! But give thyself unto my sick desires,
! Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
! My love as it begins shall so persever.
! DIANA
! I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
! That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
! BERTRAM
! I’ll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
! To give it from me.
! DIANA
! Will you not, my lord?
! BERTRAM
! It is an honour ‘longing to our house,
! Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
! Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world
! In me to lose.
! DIANA
! Mine honour’s such a ring:
! My chastity’s the jewel of our house,
! Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
! Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world
! In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
! Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
! Against your vain assault.
! BERTRAM
! Here, take my ring:
! My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
! And I’ll be bid by thee.
! DIANA
! When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
! I’ll order take my mother shall not hear.
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
! When you have conquer’d my yet maiden bed,
! Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
! My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
! When back again this ring shall be deliver’d:
! And on your finger in the night I’ll put
! Another ring, that what in time proceeds
! May token to the future our past deeds.
! Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
! A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
! BERTRAM
! A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
! [Exit]
! DIANA
! For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
  You may so in the end.
! My mother told me just how he would woo,
! As if she sat in ‘s heart; she says all men
! Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
! When his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him
! When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
! Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
! Only in this disguise I think’t no sin
! To cozen him that would unjustly win.

! Scene 3
! [The Florentine camp.]
! [Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers]
! First Lord
! You have not given him his mother’s letter?
! Second Lord
! I have delivered it an hour since: there is
! something in’t that stings his nature; for on the
! reading it he changed almost into another man.
! First Lord
! He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
! off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
! Second Lord
! Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
! displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
! bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
! thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
! First Lord
! When you have spoken it, ‘tis dead, and I am the
! grave of it.
! Second Lord
! He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
! Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
! fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
! given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
! made in the unchaste composition.
! First Lord
! Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
! what things are we!
! Second Lord
! Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
! of all treasons, we still see them reveal
! themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
! so he that in this action contrives against his own
! nobility, in his proper stream o’erflows himself.
! First Lord
! Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
! our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
! company to-night?
! Second Lord
! Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
! First Lord
! That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
! his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
! of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
! set this counterfeit.
! Second Lord
! We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
! presence must be the whip of the other.
! First Lord
! In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
! Second Lord
! I hear there is an overture of peace.
! First Lord
! Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
! Second Lord
! What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
! higher, or return again into France?
! First Lord
! I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
! of his council.
! Second Lord
! Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
! of his act.
! First Lord
! Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
! house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
! le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
! sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
! tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
! grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
! now she sings in heaven.
! Second Lord
! How is this justified?
! First Lord
! The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
! makes her story true, even to the point of her
! death: her death itself, which could not be her
! office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
! the rector of the place.
! Second Lord
! Hath the count all this intelligence?
! First Lord
! Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
! point, so to the full arming of the verity.
! Second Lord
! I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.
! First Lord
! How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
! Second Lord
! And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
! in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
! here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
! with a shame as ample.
! First Lord
! The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
! ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
! faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
! despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.
! [Enter a Messenger]
! How now! where’s your master?
! Servant
! He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
! taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
! morning for France. The duke hath offered him
! letters of commendations to the king.
! Second Lord
! They shall be no more than needful there, if they
! were more than they can commend.
! First Lord
! They cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness.
! Here’s his lordship now.
! [Enter BERTRAM]
! How now, my lord! is’t not after midnight?
! BERTRAM
! I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
! month’s length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
! I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
! nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
! lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
! and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
! many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
! that I have not ended yet.
! Second Lord
! If the business be of any difficulty, and this
! morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
! your lordship.
! BERTRAM
! I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
! hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
! dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
! bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
! me, like a double-meaning prophesier.
! Second Lord
! Bring him forth: has sat i’ the stocks all night,
! poor gallant knave.
! BERTRAM
! No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
! his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
! Second Lord
! I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
! him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
! he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
! hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
! to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
! this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the
! stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
! BERTRAM
! Nothing of me, has a’?
! Second Lord
! His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
! face: if your lordship be in’t, as I believe you
! are, you must have the patience to hear it.
! [Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier]
! BERTRAM
! A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
! me: hush, hush!
! First Lord
! Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa
! First Soldier
! He calls for the tortures: what will you say
! without ‘em?
! PAROLLES
! I will confess what I know without constraint: if
! ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
! First Soldier
! Bosko chimurcho.
! First Lord
! Boblibindo chicurmurco.
! First Soldier
! You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
! answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
! PAROLLES
! And truly, as I hope to live.
! First Soldier
! [Reads]
! ‘First demand of him how many horse the
! duke is strong.’ What say you to that?
! PAROLLES
! Five or six thousand; but very weak and
! unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
! the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
! and credit and as I hope to live.
! First Soldier
! Shall I set down your answer so?
! PAROLLES
! Do: I’ll take the sacrament on’t, how and which way you will.
! BERTRAM
! All’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
! First Lord
! You’re deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
! Parolles, the gallant militarist, — that was his own
! phrase, — that had the whole theoric of war in the
! knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
! his dagger.
! Second Lord
! I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
! clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
! by wearing his apparel neatly.
! First Soldier
! Well, that’s set down.
! PAROLLES
! Five or six thousand horse, I said, — I will say
! true, — or thereabouts, set down, for I’ll speak truth.
! First Lord
! He’s very near the truth in this.
! BERTRAM
! But I con him no thanks for’t, in the nature he
! delivers it.
! PAROLLES
! Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
! First Soldier
! Well, that’s set down.
! PAROLLES
! I humbly thank you, sir: a truth’s a truth, the
! rogues are marvellous poor.
! First Soldier
! [Reads]
! ‘Demand of him, of what strength they are
! a-foot.’ What say you to that?
! PAROLLES
! By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
! hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
! hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
! many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
! and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
! company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
! fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
! sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
! poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
! their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
! BERTRAM
! What shall be done to him?
! First Lord
! Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
! condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
! First Soldier
! Well, that’s set down.
! [Reads]
! ‘You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
! be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
! with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
! expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
! possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
! corrupt him to revolt.’ What say you to this? what
! do you know of it?
! PAROLLES
! I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
! the inter’gatories: demand them singly.
! First Soldier
! Do you know this Captain Dumain?
! PAROLLES
! I know him: a’ was a botcher’s ‘prentice in Paris,
! from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve’s
! fool with child, — a dumb innocent, that could not
! say him nay.
! BERTRAM
! Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
! his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
! First Soldier
! Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence’s camp?
! PAROLLES
! Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
! First Lord
! Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
! lordship anon.
! First Soldier
! What is his reputation with the duke?
! PAROLLES
! The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
! of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
! out o’ the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
! First Soldier
! Marry, we’ll search.
! PAROLLES
! In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
! or it is upon a file with the duke’s other letters
! in my tent.
! First Soldier
! Here ‘tis; here’s a paper: shall I read it to you?
! PAROLLES
! I do not know if it be it or no.
! BERTRAM
! Our interpreter does it well.
! First Lord
! Excellently.
! First Soldier
! [Reads]
! ‘Dian, the count’s a fool, and full of gold,’ —
! PAROLLES
! That is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an
! advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
! Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
! Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
! ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
! First Soldier
! Nay, I’ll read it first, by your favour.
! PAROLLES
! My meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the
! behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
! a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
! virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
! BERTRAM
! Damnable both-sides rogue!
! First Soldier
! [Reads]
! ‘When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
! After he scores, he never pays the score:
! Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
! He ne’er pays after-debts, take it before;
! And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
! Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
! For count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,
! Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
! Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
! PAROLLES.’
! BERTRAM
! He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
! in’s forehead.
! Second Lord
! This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
! linguist and the armipotent soldier.
! BERTRAM
! I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
! he’s a cat to me.
! First Soldier
! I perceive, sir, by the general’s looks, we shall be
! fain to hang you.
! PAROLLES
! My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
! die; but that, my offences being many, I would
! repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
! sir, in a dungeon, i’ the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
! First Soldier
! We’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
! therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
! have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
! his valour: what is his honesty?
! PAROLLES
! He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
! rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
! professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking ‘em he
! is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
! such volubility, that you would think truth were a
! fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
! be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
! harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
! know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
! little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
! every thing that an honest man should not have; what
! an honest man should have, he has nothing.
! First Lord
! I begin to love him for this.
! BERTRAM
! For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
! him for me, he’s more and more a cat.
! First Soldier
! What say you to his expertness in war?
! PAROLLES
! Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
! tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
! his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
! he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
! called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
! files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
! this I am not certain.
! First Lord
! He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
! rarity redeems him.
! BERTRAM
! A pox on him, he’s a cat still.
! First Soldier
! His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
! to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
! PAROLLES
! Sir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple
! of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
! entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
! succession for it perpetually.
! First Soldier
! What’s his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
! Second Lord
! Why does be ask him of me?
! First Soldier
! What’s he?
! PAROLLES
! E’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so
! great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
! deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
! yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
! in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
! on he has the cramp.
! First Soldier
! If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
! the Florentine?
! PAROLLES
! Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
! First Soldier
! I’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
! PAROLLES
! [Aside]
! I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all
! drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
! beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
! the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
! would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
! First Soldier
! There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
! general says, you that have so traitorously
! discovered the secrets of your army and made such
! pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
! serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
! must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.
! PAROLLES
! O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
! First Lord
! That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.
! [Unblinding him]
! So, look about you: know you any here?
! BERTRAM
! Good morrow, noble captain.
! Second Lord
! God bless you, Captain Parolles.
! First Lord
! God save you, noble captain.
! Second Lord
! Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
! I am for France.
! First Lord
! Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
! you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
! an I were not a very coward, I’ld compel it of you:
! but fare you well.
! [Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords]
! First Soldier
! You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
! has a knot on’t yet
! PAROLLES
! Who cannot be crushed with a plot?
! First Soldier
! If you could find out a country where but women were
! that had received so much shame, you might begin an
! impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
! too: we shall speak of you there.
! [Exit with Soldiers]
! PAROLLES
! Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
! ‘Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more;
! But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
! As captain shall: simply the thing I am
! Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
! Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
! that every braggart shall be found an ass.
! Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
! Safest in shame! being fool’d, by foolery thrive!
! There’s place and means for every man alive.
! I’ll after them.

! [Rousillon. The COUNT’s palace.]
! [Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown]
! LAFEU
! No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
! fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
! made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
! his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
! this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
! by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
! COUNTESS
! I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
! most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
! praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
! flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
! could not have owed her a more rooted love.
! LAFEU
! ‘Twas a good lady, ‘twas a good lady: we may pick a
! thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
! Clown
! Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
! salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
! LAFEU
! They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
! Clown
! I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
! skill in grass.
! LAFEU
! Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
! Clown
! A fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.
! LAFEU
! Your distinction?
! Clown
! I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
! LAFEU
! So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
! Clown
! And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
! LAFEU
! I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
! Clown
! At your service.
! LAFEU
! No, no, no.
! Clown
! Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
! great a prince as you are.
! LAFEU
! Who’s that? a Frenchman?
! Clown
! Faith, sir, a’ has an English name; but his fisnomy
! is more hotter in France than there.
! LAFEU
! What prince is that?
! Clown
! The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
! darkness; alias, the devil.
! LAFEU
! Hold thee, there’s my purse: I give thee not this
! to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
! serve him still.
! Clown
! I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
! great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
! good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
! world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for
! the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
! too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
! themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
! tender, and they’ll be for the flowery way that
! leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
! LAFEU
! Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
! tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
! with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
! looked to, without any tricks.
! Clown
! If I put any tricks upon ‘em, sir, they shall be
! jades’ tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
! [Exit]
! LAFEU
! A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
! COUNTESS
! So he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much
! sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
! which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
! indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
! LAFEU
! I like him well; ‘tis not amiss. And I was about to
! tell you, since I heard of the good lady’s death and
! that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
! moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
! my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
! his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
! first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
! it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
! conceived against your son, there is no fitter
! matter. How does your ladyship like it?
! COUNTESS
! With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
! happily effected.
! LAFEU
! His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
! body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
! to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
! intelligence hath seldom failed.
! COUNTESS
! It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
! die. I have letters that my son will be here
! to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
! with me till they meet together.
! LAFEU
! Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
! safely be admitted.
! COUNTESS
! You need but plead your honourable privilege.
! LAFEU
! Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
! thank my God it holds yet.
! [Re-enter Clown]
! Clown
! O madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of
! velvet on’s face: whether there be a scar under’t
! or no, the velvet knows; but ‘tis a goodly patch of
! velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
! half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
! LAFEU
! A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
! of honour; so belike is that.
! Clown
! But it is your carbonadoed face.
! LAFEU
! Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
! with the young noble soldier.

! hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
! and nod at every man.

! And deeper than oblivion we do bury
! The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
! A stranger, no offender; and inform him
! So ‘tis our will he should.
! Gentleman
! I shall, my liege.
! [Exit]
! KING
! What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?
! LAFEU
! All that he is hath reference to your highness.
! KING
! Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
! That set him high in fame.
! [Enter BERTRAM]
! LAFEU
! He looks well on’t.
! KING
! I am not a day of season,
! For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
! In me at once: but to the brightest beams
! Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
! The time is fair again.
! BERTRAM
! My high-repented blames,
! Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
! KING
! All is whole;
! Not one word more of the consumed time.
! Let’s take the instant by the forward top;
  For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees
! The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
! Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
! The daughter of this lord?
! BERTRAM
! Admiringly, my liege, at first
! I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
! Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
! Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
! Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
! Which warp’d the line of every other favour;
! Scorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen;
  Extended or contracted all proportions
! To a most hideous object: thence it came
! That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
! Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
! The dust that did offend it.
! KING
! Well excused:
! That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
! From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
! Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
! To the great sender turns a sour offence,
! Crying, ‘That’s good that’s gone.’ Our rash faults
! Make trivial price of serious things we have,
! Not knowing them until we know their grave:
! Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
! Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
! Our own love waking cries to see what’s done,
! While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
! Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.
! Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
! The main consents are had; and here we’ll stay
! To see our widower’s second marriage-day.
! COUNTESS
! Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
! Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
! LAFEU
! Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name
! Must be digested, give a favour from you
  To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
! That she may quickly come.
! [BERTRAM gives a ring]
! By my old beard,
! And every hair that’s on’t, Helen, that’s dead,
  Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
! The last that e’er I took her at court,
! I saw upon her finger.
! BERTRAM
! Hers it was not.
! KING
! Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
! While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to’t.
! This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
! I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
! Necessitied to help, that by this token
! I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
! her
  Of what should stead her most?
! BERTRAM
! My gracious sovereign,
! Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,
! The ring was never hers.
! COUNTESS
! Son, on my life,
! I have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it
! At her life’s rate.
! LAFEU
! I am sure I saw her wear it.
! BERTRAM
! You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
! In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
! Wrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name
! Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
! I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
! To mine own fortune and inform’d her fully
! I could not answer in that course of honour
! As she had made the overture, she ceased
! In heavy satisfaction and would never
! Receive the ring again.
! KING
! Plutus himself,
! That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
! Hath not in nature’s mystery more science
! Than I have in this ring: ‘twas mine, ‘twas Helen’s,
! Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
! That you are well acquainted with yourself,
! Confess ‘twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
! You got it from her: she call’d the saints to surety
! That she would never put it from her finger,
! Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
! Where you have never come, or sent it us
! Upon her great disaster.
! BERTRAM
! She never saw it.
! KING
! Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
! And makest conjectural fears to come into me
! Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
! That thou art so inhuman, — ‘twill not prove so; —
! And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
! And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
! Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
! More than to see this ring. Take him away.
! [Guards seize BERTRAM]
! My fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,
! Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
! Having vainly fear’d too little. Away with him!
! We’ll sift this matter further.
! BERTRAM
! If you shall prove
! This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
! Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
! Where yet she never was.
! [Exit, guarded]
! KING
! I am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.
! [Enter a Gentleman]
! Gentleman
! Gracious sovereign,
! Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
  Here’s a petition from a Florentine,
! Who hath for four or five removes come short
! To tender it herself. I undertook it,
! Vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech
! Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
! Is here attending: her business looks in her
! With an importing visage; and she told me,
! In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
! Your highness with herself.
! KING
! [Reads]
! Upon his many protestations to marry me
! when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
! me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
! are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid to him. He
! stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
! him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
! king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
! flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
! DIANA CAPILET.
! LAFEU
! I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
! this: I’ll none of him.
! KING
! The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
! To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
! Go speedily and bring again the count.
! I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
! Was foully snatch’d.
! COUNTESS
! Now, justice on the doers!
! [Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded]
! KING
! I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
! And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
! Yet you desire to marry.
! [Enter Widow and DIANA]
! What woman’s that?
! DIANA
! I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
! Derived from the ancient Capilet:
! My suit, as I do understand, you know,
! And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
! Widow
! I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
! Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
! And both shall cease, without your remedy.
! KING
! Come hither, count; do you know these women?
! BERTRAM
! My lord, I neither can nor will deny
! But that I know them: do they charge me further?
! DIANA
! Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
! BERTRAM
! She’s none of mine, my lord.
! DIANA
! If you shall marry,
! You give away this hand, and that is mine;
! You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine;
! You give away myself, which is known mine;
  For I by vow am so embodied yours,
! That she which marries you must marry me,
! Either both or none.
! LAFEU
! Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
! are no husband for her.
! BERTRAM
! My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
! Whom sometime I have laugh’d with: let your highness
! Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
! Than for to think that I would sink it here.
! KING
! Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
! Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
! Than in my thought it lies.
! DIANA
! Good my lord,
! Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
! He had not my virginity.
! KING
! What say’st thou to her?
! BERTRAM
! She’s impudent, my lord,
! And was a common gamester to the camp.
! DIANA
! He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
! He might have bought me at a common price:
! Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
! Whose high respect and rich validity
! Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
! He gave it to a commoner o’ the camp,
! If I be one.
! COUNTESS
! He blushes, and ‘tis it:
! Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
! Conferr’d by testament to the sequent issue,
! Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
! That ring’s a thousand proofs.
! KING
! Methought you said
! You saw one here in court could witness it.
! DIANA
! I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
! So bad an instrument: his name’s Parolles.
! LAFEU
! I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
! KING
! Find him, and bring him hither.
! [Exit an Attendant]
! BERTRAM
! What of him?
! He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,
! With all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debosh’d;
! Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
! Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,
! That will speak any thing?
! KING
! She hath that ring of yours.
! BERTRAM
! I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
! And boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth:
! She knew her distance and did angle for me,
! Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
! As all impediments in fancy’s course
! Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
! Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
! Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
! And I had that which any inferior might
! At market-price have bought.
! DIANA
! I must be patient:
! You, that have turn’d off a first so noble wife,
! May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
! Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
! Send for your ring, I will return it home,
! And give me mine again.
! BERTRAM
! I have it not.
! KING
! What ring was yours, I pray you?
! DIANA
! Sir, much like
! The same upon your finger.
! KING
! Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
! DIANA
! And this was it I gave him, being abed.
! KING
! The story then goes false, you threw it him
! Out of a casement.
! DIANA
! I have spoke the truth.
! [Enter PAROLLES]
! BERTRAM
! My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
! KING
! You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
! Is this the man you speak of?
! DIANA
! Ay, my lord.
! KING
! Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
! Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
! Which on your just proceeding I’ll keep off,
! By him and by this woman here what know you?
! PAROLLES
! So please your majesty, my master hath been an
! honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
! which gentlemen have.
! KING
! Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
! PAROLLES
! Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
! KING
! How, I pray you?
! PAROLLES
! He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
! KING
! How is that?
! PAROLLES
! He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
! KING
! As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
! equivocal companion is this!
! PAROLLES
! I am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.
! LAFEU
! He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
! DIANA
! Do you know he promised me marriage?
! PAROLLES
! Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.
! KING
! But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
! PAROLLES
! Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
! as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
! indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
! of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
! was in that credit with them at that time that I
! knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
! as promising her marriage, and things which would
! derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
! speak what I know.
! KING
! Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
! they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
! evidence; therefore stand aside.
! This ring, you say, was yours?
! DIANA
! Ay, my good lord.
! KING
! Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
! DIANA
! It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
! KING
! Who lent it you?
! DIANA
! It was not lent me neither.
! KING
! Where did you find it, then?
! DIANA
! I found it not.
! KING
! If it were yours by none of all these ways,
! How could you give it him?
! DIANA
! I never gave it him.
! LAFEU
! This woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
! and on at pleasure.
! KING
! This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
! DIANA
! It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
! KING
! Take her away; I do not like her now;
! To prison with her: and away with him.
! Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,
! Thou diest within this hour.
! DIANA
! I’ll never tell you.
! KING
! Take her away.
! DIANA
! I’ll put in bail, my liege.
! KING
! I think thee now some common customer.
! DIANA
! By Jove, if ever I knew man, ‘twas you.
! KING
! Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
! DIANA
! Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty:
! He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t;
! I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
! Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
! I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.
! KING
! She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
! DIANA
! Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
! [Exit Widow]
! The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
! And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
! Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
! Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him:
! He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
! And at that time he got his wife with child:
! Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
! So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick:
  And now behold the meaning.
! [Re-enter Widow, with HELENA]
! KING
! Is there no exorcist
! Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
! Is’t real that I see?
! HELENA
! No, my good lord;
  ‘Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
! The name and not the thing.
! BERTRAM
! Both, both. O, pardon!
! HELENA
! O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
! I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
! And, look you, here’s your letter; this it says:
! ‘When from my finger you can get this ring
! And are by me with child,’ &c. This is done:
! Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
! BERTRAM
! If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
! I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
! HELENA
! If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
! Deadly divorce step between me and you!
! O my dear mother, do I see you living?
! LAFEU
! Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
! [To PAROLLES]
! Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
! I thank thee: wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee:
! Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
! KING
! Let us from point to point this story know,
! To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
! [To DIANA]
! If thou be’st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
! Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;
! For I can guess that by thy honest aid
! Thou keep’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
! Of that and all the progress, more or less,
! Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
! All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
  The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
! [Flourish]
! ––––––––––––—
! EPILOGUE
! KING
! The king’s a beggar, now the play is done:
! All is well ended, if this suit be won,
! That you express content; which we will pay,
  With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
! Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
! Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

! Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
! all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
! copyright notice is included. Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
! of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
! We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
! of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
! Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till
! midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
! The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
! Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A
! preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
! and editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you have an
! up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
! in the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has
! a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
! look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
! new copy has at least one byte more or less.
! Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
! We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
! time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
! to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
! searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This
! projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value
! per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
! million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
! files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
! If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
! total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
! The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
! Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
! This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
! which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
! At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
! of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
! manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
! from Michael Hart’s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
! assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
! more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
! don’t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

! Executive Director’s Notes:
! In addition to the notes below, and so you will NOT think all
! the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
! been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
! are presented herein:

! As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
! or letters they had often packed into a “cliche”…this is the
! original meaning of the term cliche…and thus, being unwilling
! to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
! that look very odd…such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
! above…and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
! Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner… .
! The answer is that they MAY have packed “liue” into a cliche at a
! time when they were out of “v“‘s…possibly having used “vv” in
! place of some “w“‘s, etc. This was a common practice of the day,
! as print was still quite expensive, and they didn’t want to spend
! more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
! You will find a lot of these kinds of “errors” in this text, as I
! have mentioned in other times and places, many “scholars” have an
! extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
! very high place in the “canon” of Shakespeare. My father read an
! assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
! in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
! purpose. To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
! …in great detail…and determined from the various changes,
! that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
! variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
! for signing his name with several different spellings.
! So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
! made by our volunteer who prepared this file: you may see errors
! that are “not” errors… .
! So…with this caveat…we have NOT changed the canon errors,
! here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare’s The first
! Part of Henry the Sixt.

! Scanner’s Notes: What this is and isn’t. This was taken from
! a copy of Shakespeare’s first folio and it is as close as I can
! come in ASCII to the printed text.
! The elongated S’s have been changed to small s’s and the
! conjoined ae have been changed to ae. I have left the spelling,
! punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
! printed text. I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
! together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
! Geneva Bible and Shakespeare’s First Folio and have unified
! spellings according to this template), typo’s and expanded
! abbreviations as I have come across them. Everything within
! brackets [] is what I have added. So if you don’t like that
! you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
! purer Shakespeare.
! Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
! differences between various copies of the first folio. So there may
! be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
! this and other first folio editions. This is due to the printer’s
! habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
! then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
! continuing the printing run. The proof run wasn’t thrown away but
! incorporated into the printed copies. This is just the way it is.
! The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
! First Folio editions’ best pages.
! If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
! errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
! free to email me those errors. I wish to make this the best
! etext possible. My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
! and davidr@inconnect.com. I hope that you enjoy this.

! Enter yong Bertram Count of Rossillion, his Mother, and Helena,
! Lord
! Lafew, all in blacke.
! Mother. In deliuering my sonne from me, I burie a second
! husband
! Ros. And I in going Madam, weep ore my
! fathers death anew; but I must attend his maiesties
! command, to whom I am now in Ward, euermore
! in subiection
! Laf. You shall find of the King a husband Madame,
! you sir a father. He that so generally is at all times good,
! must of necessitie hold his vertue to you, whose worthinesse
! would stirre it vp where it wanted rather then lack
! it where there is such abundance
! Mo. What hope is there of his Maiesties amendment?
! Laf. He hath abandon’d his Phisitions Madam, vnder
! whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope,
! and finds no other aduantage in the processe, but onely
! the loosing of hope by time
! Mo. This yong Gentlewoman had a father, O that
! had, how sad a passage tis, whose skill was almost as
! great as his honestie, had it stretch’d so far, would haue
! made nature immortall, and death should haue play for
! lacke of worke. Would for the Kings sake hee were liuing,
! I thinke it would be the death of the Kings disease
! Laf. How call’d you the man you speake of Madam?
! Mo. He was famous sir in his profession, and it was
! his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon
! Laf. He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very
! latelie spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly: hee
! was skilfull enough to haue liu’d stil, if knowledge could
! be set vp against mortallitie
! Ros. What is it (my good Lord) the King languishes
! of?
! Laf. A Fistula my Lord
! Ros. I heard not of it before
! Laf. I would it were not notorious. Was this Gentlewoman
! the Daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
! Mo. His sole childe my Lord, and bequeathed to my
! ouer looking. I haue those hopes of her good, that her
! education promises her dispositions shee inherits, which
! makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind carries
! vertuous qualities, there commendations go with
! pitty, they are vertues and traitors too: in her they are
! the better for their simplenesse; she deriues her honestie,
! and atcheeues her goodnesse
! Lafew. Your commendations Madam get from her
! teares
! Mo. ‘Tis the best brine a Maiden can season her praise
! in. The remembrance of her father neuer approches her
! heart, but the tirrany of her sorrowes takes all liuelihood
! from her cheeke. No more of this Helena, go too, no
! more least it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, then
! to haue—
! Hell. I doe affect a sorrow indeed, but I haue it too
! Laf. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
! excessiue greefe the enemie to the liuing
! Mo. If the liuing be enemie to the greefe, the excesse
! makes it soone mortall
! Ros. Maddam I desire your holie wishes
! Laf. How vnderstand we that?
! Mo. Be thou blest Bertrame, and succeed thy father
! In manners as in shape: thy blood and vertue
! Contend for Empire in thee, and thy goodnesse
! Share with thy birth-right. Loue all, trust a few,
! Doe wrong to none: be able for thine enemie
! Rather in power then vse: and keepe thy friend
! Vnder thy owne lifes key. Be checkt for silence,
! But neuer tax’d for speech. What heauen more wil,
! That thee may furnish, and my prayers plucke downe,
! Fall on thy head. Farwell my Lord,
! ‘Tis an vnseason’d Courtier, good my Lord
! Aduise him
! Laf. He cannot want the best
! That shall attend his loue
! Mo. Heauen blesse him: Farwell Bertram
! Ro. The best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoghts
! be seruants to you: be comfortable to my mother, your
! Mistris, and make much of her
! Laf. Farewell prettie Lady, you must hold the credit
! of your father
! Hell. O were that all, I thinke not on my father,
! And these great teares grace his remembrance more
! Then those I shed for him. What was he like?
! I haue forgott him. My imagination
! Carries no fauour in’t but Bertrams.
! I am vndone, there is no liuing, none,
! If Bertram be away. ‘Twere all one,
! That I should loue a bright particuler starre,
! And think to wed it, he is so aboue me
! In his bright radience and colaterall light,
! Must I be comforted, not in his sphere;
! Th’ ambition in my loue thus plagues it selfe:
! The hind that would be mated by the Lion
! Must die for loue. ‘Twas prettie, though a plague
! To see him euerie houre to sit and draw
! His arched browes, his hawking eie, his curles
! In our hearts table: heart too capeable
! Of euerie line and tricke of his sweet fauour.
! But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancie
! Must sanctifie his Reliques. Who comes heere?
! Enter Parrolles.
! One that goes with him: I loue him for his sake,
! And yet I know him a notorious Liar,
! Thinke him a great way foole, solie a coward,
! Yet these fixt euils sit so fit in him,
! That they take place, when Vertues steely bones
! Lookes bleake i’th cold wind: withall, full ofte we see
! Cold wisedome waighting on superfluous follie
! Par. Saue you faire Queene
! Hel. And you Monarch
! Par. No
! Hel. And no
! Par. Are you meditating on virginitie?
! Hel. I: you haue some staine of souldier in you: Let
! mee aske you a question. Man is enemie to virginitie,
! how may we barracado it against him?
! Par. Keepe him out
! Hel. But he assailes, and our virginitie though valiant,
! in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs some warlike
! resistance
! Par. There is none: Man setting downe before you,
! will vndermine you, and blow you vp
! Hel. Blesse our poore Virginity from vnderminers
! and blowers vp. Is there no Military policy how Virgins
! might blow vp men?
! Par. Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will
! quicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe
! againe, with the breach your selues made, you lose your
! Citty. It is not politicke, in the Common-wealth of
! Nature, to preserue virginity. Losse of Virginitie, is
! rationall encrease, and there was neuer Virgin goe, till
! virginitie was first lost. That you were made of, is mettall
! to make Virgins. Virginitie, by beeing once lost,
! may be ten times found: by being euer kept, it is euer
! lost: ‘tis too cold a companion: Away with’t
! Hel. I will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die
! a Virgin
! Par. There’s little can bee saide in’t, ‘tis against the
! rule of Nature. To speake on the part of virginitie, is
! to accuse your Mothers; which is most infallible disobedience.
! He that hangs himselfe is a Virgin: Virginitie
! murthers it selfe, and should be buried in highwayes
! out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate Offendresse against
! Nature. Virginitie breedes mites, much like a
! Cheese, consumes it selfe to the very payring, and so
! dies with feeding his owne stomacke. Besides, Virginitie
! is peeuish, proud, ydle, made of selfe-loue, which
! is the most inhibited sinne in the Cannon. Keepe it not,
! you cannot choose but loose by’t. Out with’t: within
! ten yeare it will make it selfe two, which is a goodly increase,
! and the principall it selfe not much the worse.
! Away with’t
! Hel. How might one do sir, to loose it to her owne
! liking?
! Par. Let mee see. Marry ill, to like him that ne’re
! it likes. ‘Tis a commodity wil lose the glosse with lying:
! The longer kept, the lesse worth: Off with’t while ‘tis
! vendible. Answer the time of request, Virginitie like
! an olde Courtier, weares her cap out of fashion, richly
! suted, but vnsuteable, iust like the brooch & the tooth-pick,
! which were not now: your Date is better in your
! Pye and your Porredge, then in your cheeke: and your
! virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French
! wither’d peares, it lookes ill, it eates drily, marry ‘tis a
! wither’d peare: it was formerly better, marry yet ‘tis a
! wither’d peare: Will you any thing with it?
! Hel. Not my virginity yet:
! There shall your Master haue a thousand loues,
! A Mother, and a Mistresse, and a friend,
! A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,
! A guide, a Goddesse, and a Soueraigne,
! A Counsellor, a Traitoresse, and a Deare:
! His humble ambition, proud humility:
! His iarring, concord: and his discord, dulcet:
! His faith, his sweet disaster: with a world
! Of pretty fond adoptious christendomes
! That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he:
! I know not what he shall, God send him well,
! The Courts a learning place, and he is one
! Par. What one ifaith?
! Hel. That I wish well, ‘tis pitty
! Par. What’s pitty?
! Hel. That wishing well had not a body in’t,
! Which might be felt, that we the poorer borne,
! Whose baser starres do shut vs vp in wishes,
  Might with effects of them follow our friends,
! And shew what we alone must thinke, which neuer
! Returnes vs thankes.
! Enter Page.
! Pag. Monsieur Parrolles,
! My Lord cals for you
! Par. Little Hellen farewell, if I can remember thee, I
! will thinke of thee at Court
! Hel. Monsieur Parolles, you were borne vnder a
! charitable starre
! Par. Vnder Mars I
! Hel. I especially thinke, vnder Mars
! Par. Why vnder Mars?
! Hel. The warres hath so kept you vnder, that you
! must needes be borne vnder Mars
! Par. When he was predominant
! Hel. When he was retrograde I thinke rather
! Par. Why thinke you so?
! Hel. You go so much backward when you fight
! Par. That’s for aduantage
! Hel. So is running away,
! When feare proposes the safetie:
! But the composition that your valour and feare makes
! in you, is a vertue of a good wing, and I like the
! weare well
! Paroll. I am so full of businesses, I cannot answere
! thee acutely: I will returne perfect Courtier, in the
! which my instruction shall serue to naturalize thee, so
! thou wilt be capeable of a Courtiers councell, and vnderstand
! what aduice shall thrust vppon thee, else thou
! diest in thine vnthankfulnes, and thine ignorance makes
! thee away, farewell: When thou hast leysure, say thy
! praiers: when thou hast none, remember thy Friends:
! Get thee a good husband, and vse him as he vses thee:
! So farewell
! Hel. Our remedies oft in our selues do lye,
! Which we ascribe to heauen: the fated skye
! Giues vs free scope, onely doth backward pull
! Our slow designes, when we our selues are dull.
! What power is it, which mounts my loue so hye,
! That makes me see, and cannot feede mine eye?
! The mightiest space in fortune, Nature brings
! To ioyne like, likes; and kisse like natiue things.
  Impossible be strange attempts to those
! That weigh their paines in sence, and do suppose
! What hath beene, cannot be. Who euer stroue
! To shew her merit, that did misse her loue?
! (The Kings disease) my proiect may deceiue me,
! But my intents are fixt, and will not leaue me.
! Exit
! Flourish Cornets. Enter the King of France with Letters, and diuers

! King. The Florentines and Senoys are by th’ eares,
! Haue fought with equall fortune, and continue

! 1.Lo.G. So tis reported sir
! King. Nay tis most credible, we heere receiue it,
! A certaintie vouch’d from our Cosin Austria,
! With caution, that the Florentine will moue vs
! For speedie ayde: wherein our deerest friend
! Preiudicates the businesse, and would seeme
! To haue vs make deniall
! 1.Lo.G. His loue and wisedome
! Approu’d so to your Maiesty, may pleade
! For amplest credence
! King. He hath arm’d our answer,

! To stand on either part
! 2.Lo.E. It well may serue

! 1.Lor.G. It is the Count Rosignoll my good Lord,
! Yong Bertram
! King. Youth, thou bear’st thy Fathers face,
! Franke Nature rather curious then in hast
! Hath well compos’d thee: Thy Fathers morall parts
! Maist thou inherit too: Welcome to Paris
! Ber. My thankes and dutie are your Maiesties
! Kin. I would I had that corporall soundnesse now,
! As when thy father, and my selfe, in friendship
! First tride our souldiership: he did looke farre
! Into the seruice of the time, and was
! Discipled of the brauest. He lasted long,
! But on vs both did haggish Age steale on,
! And wore vs out of act: It much repaires me
! To talke of your good father; in his youth
! He had the wit, which I can well obserue
! To day in our yong Lords: but they may iest
! Till their owne scorne returne to them vnnoted
! Ere they can hide their leuitie in honour:
! So like a Courtier, contempt nor bitternesse
! Were in his pride, or sharpnesse; if they were,
! His equall had awak’d them, and his honour
! Clocke to it selfe, knew the true minute when
! Exception bid him speake: and at this time
! His tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him,
! He vs’d as creatures of another place,
! And bow’d his eminent top to their low rankes,
! Making them proud of his humilitie,
! In their poore praise he humbled: Such a man
! Might be a copie to these yonger times;
! Which followed well, would demonstrate them now
! But goers backward
! Ber. His good remembrance sir
! Lies richer in your thoughts, then on his tombe:
! So in approofe liues not his Epitaph,
! As in your royall speech
! King. Would I were with him he would alwaies say,
! (Me thinkes I heare him now) his plausiue words
! He scatter’d not in eares, but grafted them
! To grow there and to beare: Let me not liue,
! This his good melancholly oft began
! On the Catastrophe and heele of pastime
! When it was out: Let me not liue (quoth hee)
! After my flame lackes oyle, to be the snuffe
! Of yonger spirits, whose apprehensiue senses
! All but new things disdaine; whose iudgements are
! Meere fathers of their garments: whose constancies
! Expire before their fashions: this he wish’d.
! I after him, do after him wish too:
! Since I nor wax nor honie can bring home,
! I quickly were dissolued from my hiue
! To giue some Labourers roome
! 2.L.E. You’r loued Sir,
! They that least lend it you, shall lacke you first
! Kin. I fill a place I know’t: how long ist Count
! Since the Physitian at your fathers died?

! ‘Tis not so well that I am poore, though manie
! of the rich are damn’d, but if I may haue your Ladiships

! Coun. Wilt thou needes be a begger?

! Clo. In Isbels case and mine owne: seruice is no heritage,
! and I thinke I shall neuer haue the blessing of God,
! till I haue issue a my bodie: for they say barnes are blessings
! Cou. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marrie?
! Clo. My poore bodie Madam requires it, I am driuen

! driues
! Cou. Is this all your worships reason?
! Clo. Faith Madam I haue other holie reasons, such as
! they are
! Cou. May the world know them?
! Clo. I haue beene Madam a wicked creature, as you
! and all flesh and blood are, and indeede I doe marrie that
! I may repent
! Cou. Thy marriage sooner then thy wickednesse
! Clo. I am out a friends Madam, and I hope to haue
! friends for my wiues sake
! Cou. Such friends are thine enemies knaue
! Clo. Y’are shallow Madam in great friends, for the
! knaues come to doe that for me which I am a wearie of:
! he that eres my Land, spares my teame, and giues mee
! leaue to Inne the crop: if I be his cuckold hee’s my
! drudge; he that comforts my wife, is the cherisher of
! my flesh and blood; hee that cherishes my flesh and
! blood, loues my flesh and blood; he that loues my flesh
! and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my
! friend: if men could be contented to be what they are,
! there were no feare in marriage, for yong Charbon the
! Puritan, and old Poysam the Papist, how somere their
! hearts are seuer’d in Religion, their heads are both one,
! they may ioule horns together like any Deare i’th Herd
! Cou. Wilt thou euer be a foule mouth’d and calumnious
! knaue?
! Clo. A Prophet I Madam, and I speake the truth the

! true shall finde, your marriage comes by destinie, your
! Cuckow sings by kinde
! Cou. Get you gone sir, Ile talke with you more anon
! Stew. May it please you Madam, that hee bid Hellen

! Clo. Was this faire face the cause, quoth she,
! Why the Grecians sacked Troy,
! Fond done, done, fond was this King Priams ioy,
  With that she sighed as she stood,

! And gaue this sentence then, among nine bad if one be
! good, among nine bad if one be good, there’s yet one
! good in ten
! Cou. What, one good in tenne? you corrupt the song
! sirra
! Clo. One good woman in ten Madam, which is a purifying
! ath’ song: would God would serue the world so
! all the yeere, weed finde no fault with the tithe woman
! if I were the Parson, one in ten quoth a? and wee might
! haue a good woman borne but ore euerie blazing starre,
! or at an earthquake, ‘twould mend the Lotterie well, a

! Cou. Youle begone sir knaue, and doe as I command

! yet no hurt done, though honestie be no Puritan, yet
! it will doe no hurt, it will weare the Surplis of humilitie
! ouer the blacke-Gowne of a bigge heart: I am going

! Enter.
! Cou. Well now
! Stew. I know Madam you loue your Gentlewoman

! Cou. Faith I doe: her Father bequeath’d her to mee,
! and she her selfe without other aduantage, may lawfullie
! make title to as much loue as shee findes, there is

! her then sheele demand
! Stew. Madam, I was verie late more neere her then
! I thinke shee wisht mee, alone shee was, and did
! communicate to her selfe her owne words to her
! owne eares, shee thought, I dare vowe for her, they
! toucht not anie stranger sence, her matter was, shee
! loued your Sonne; Fortune shee said was no goddesse,
! that had put such difference betwixt their two

! onelie, where qualities were leuell, Queene of Virgins,
! that would suffer her poore Knight surpris’d
! without rescue in the first assault or ransome afterward:
! This shee deliuer’d in the most bitter touch of
! sorrow that ere I heard Virgin exclaime in, which I held
! my dutie speedily to acquaint you withall, sithence in

! to know it
! Cou. You haue discharg’d this honestlie, keepe it

! Hell. Pardon Madam.
! The Count Rosillion cannot be my brother:
! I am from humble, he from honored name:
! No note vpon my Parents, his all noble,
! My Master, my deere Lord he is, and I
! His seruant liue, and will his vassall die:
! He must not be my brother
! Ol.Cou. Nor I your Mother
! Hell. You are my mother Madam, would you were
! So that my Lord your sonne were not my brother,
! Indeede my mother, or were you both our mothers,
! I care no more for, then I doe for heauen,
! So I were not his sister, cant no other,
! But I your daughter, he must be my brother
! Old.Cou. Yes Hellen, you might be my daughter in law,
! God shield you meane it not, daughter and mother
! So striue vpon your pulse; what pale agen?
! My feare hath catcht your fondnesse! now I see
! The mistrie of your louelinesse, and finde
! Your salt teares head, now to all sence ‘tis grosse:
! You loue my sonne, inuention is asham’d
! Against the proclamation of thy passion
! To say thou doost not: therefore tell me true,
! But tell me then ‘tis so, for looke, thy cheekes
! Confesse it ‘ton tooth to th’ other, and thine eies
! See it so grosely showne in thy behauiours,
! That in their kinde they speake it, onely sinne
! And hellish obstinacie tye thy tongue
! That truth should be suspected, speake, ist so?
! If it be so, you haue wound a goodly clewe:
! If it be not, forsweare’t how ere I charge thee,
! As heauen shall worke in me for thine auaile
! To tell me truelie
! Hell. Good Madam pardon me
! Cou. Do you loue my Sonne?
! Hell. Your pardon noble Mistris
! Cou. Loue you my Sonne?
! Hell. Doe not you loue him Madam?
! Cou. Goe not about; my loue hath in’t a bond
! Whereof the world takes note: Come, come, disclose:
! The state of your affection, for your passions
! Haue to the full appeach’d
! Hell. Then I confesse
! Here on my knee, before high heauen and you,
! That before you, and next vnto high heauen, I loue your
! Sonne:
! My friends were poore but honest, so’s my loue:
! Be not offended, for it hurts not him
! That he is lou’d of me; I follow him not
! By any token of presumptuous suite,
! Nor would I haue him, till I doe deserue him,
! Yet neuer know how that desert should be:
! I know I loue in vaine, striue against hope:
! Yet in this captious, and intemible Siue.
! I still poure in the waters of my loue
! And lacke not to loose still; thus Indian like
  Religious in mine error, I adore
! The Sunne that lookes vpon his worshipper,
! But knowes of him no more. My deerest Madam,
! Let not your hate incounter with my loue,
! For louing where you doe; but if your selfe,
! Whose aged honor cites a vertuous youth,
! Did euer, in so true a flame of liking,
! Wish chastly, and loue dearely, that your Dian
! Was both her selfe and loue, O then giue pittie
! To her whose state is such, that cannot choose
! But lend and giue where she is sure to loose;
! That seekes not to finde that, her search implies,
! But riddle like, liues sweetely where she dies
! Cou. Had you not lately an intent, speake truely,
! To goe to Paris?
! Hell. Madam I had
! Cou. Wherefore? tell true
! Hell. I will tell truth, by grace it selfe I sweare:
! You know my Father left me some prescriptions
! Of rare and prou’d effects, such as his reading
! And manifest experience, had collected
! For generall soueraigntie: and that he wil’d me
! In heedefull’st reseruation to bestow them,
! As notes, whose faculties inclusiue were,
! More then they were in note: Amongst the rest,
! There is a remedie, approu’d, set downe,
  To cure the desperate languishings whereof
! The King is render’d lost
! Cou. This was your motiue for Paris, was it, speake?
! Hell. My Lord, your sonne, made me to think of this;
! Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
! Had from the conuersation of my thoughts,
! Happily beene absent then
! Cou. But thinke you Hellen,
! If you should tender your supposed aide,
! He would receiue it? He and his Phisitions
! Are of a minde, he, that they cannot helpe him:
! They, that they cannot helpe, how shall they credit
! A poore vnlearned Virgin, when the Schooles
! Embowel’d of their doctrine, haue left off
! The danger to it selfe
! Hell. There’s something in’t
! More then my Fathers skill, which was the great’st
! Of his profession, that his good receipt,
! Shall for my legacie be sanctified
! Byth’ luckiest stars in heauen, and would your honor
! But giue me leaue to trie successe, I’de venture
! The well lost life of mine, on his Graces cure,
! By such a day, an houre
! Cou. Doo’st thou beleeue’t?
! Hell. I Madam knowingly
! Cou. Why Hellen thou shalt haue my leaue and loue,
! Meanes and attendants, and my louing greetings
! To those of mine in Court, Ile staie at home
! And praie Gods blessing into thy attempt:
! Begon to morrow, and be sure of this,
! What I can helpe thee to, thou shalt not misse.
! Exeunt.
! Actus Secundus.
! Enter the King with diuers yong Lords, taking leaue for the
! Florentine
! warre: Count, Rosse, and Parrolles. Florish Cornets.
! King. Farewell yong Lords, these warlike principles
! Doe not throw from you, and you my Lords farewell:
! Share the aduice betwixt you, if both gaine, all
! The guift doth stretch it selfe as ‘tis receiu’d,
! And is enough for both
! Lord.G. ‘Tis our hope sir,
! After well entred souldiers, to returne
! And finde your grace in health
! King. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
! Will not confesse he owes the mallady
! That doth my life besiege: farwell yong Lords,
! Whether I liue or die, be you the sonnes
! Of worthy French men: let higher Italy
! (Those bated that inherit but the fall
! Of the last Monarchy) see that you come
! Not to wooe honour, but to wed it, when
! The brauest questant shrinkes: finde what you seeke,
! That fame may cry you loud: I say farewell
! L.G. Health at your bidding serue your Maiesty
! King. Those girles of Italy, take heed of them,
! They say our French, lacke language to deny
! If they demand: beware of being Captiues
! Before you serue
! Bo. Our hearts receiue your warnings
! King. Farewell, come hether to me
! 1.Lo.G. Oh my sweet Lord y you wil stay behind vs
! Parr. ‘Tis not his fault the spark
! 2.Lo.E. Oh ‘tis braue warres
! Parr. Most admirable, I haue seene those warres
! Rossill. I am commanded here, and kept a coyle with,
! Too young, and the next yeere, and ‘tis too early
! Parr. And thy minde stand too’t boy,
! Steale away brauely
! Rossill. I shal stay here the for-horse to a smocke,
! Creeking my shooes on the plaine Masonry,
! Till honour be bought vp, and no sword worne
! But one to dance with: by heauen, Ile steale away
! 1.Lo.G. There’s honour in the theft
! Parr. Commit it Count
! 2.Lo.E. I am your accessary, and so farewell
! Ros. I grow to you, & our parting is a tortur’d body
! 1.Lo.G. Farewell Captaine
! 2.Lo.E. Sweet Mounsier Parolles
! Parr. Noble Heroes; my sword and yours are kinne,
! good sparkes and lustrous, a word good mettals. You
! shall finde in the Regiment of the Spinij, one Captaine
! Spurio his sicatrice, with an Embleme of warre heere on
! his sinister cheeke; it was this very sword entrench’d it:
! say to him I liue, and obserue his reports for me
! Lo.G. We shall noble Captaine
! Parr. Mars doate on you for his nouices, what will
! ye doe?
! Ross. Stay the King
! Parr. Vse a more spacious ceremonie to the Noble
! Lords, you haue restrain’d your selfe within the List of
! too cold an adieu: be more expressiue to them; for they
! weare themselues in the cap of the time, there do muster
! true gate; eat, speake, and moue vnder the influence of

! Ross. And I will doe so
! Parr. Worthy fellowes, and like to prooue most sinewie

! Exeunt.
! Enter Lafew.
! L.Laf. Pardon my Lord for mee and for my tidings
! King. Ile see thee to stand vp
! L.Laf. Then heres a man stands that has brought his pardon,
! I would you had kneel’d my Lord to aske me mercy,
! And that at my bidding you could so stand vp
! King. I would I had, so I had broke thy pate
! And askt thee mercy for’t
! Laf. Goodfaith a-crosse, but my good Lord ‘tis thus,
! Will you be cur’d of your infirmitie?
! King. No
! Laf. O will you eat no grapes my royall foxe?
! Yes but you will, my noble grapes, and if
! My royall foxe could reach them: I haue seen a medicine
! That’s able to breath life into a stone,
! Quicken a rocke, and make you dance Canari
! With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch
! Is powerfull to arayse King Pippen, nay
! To giue great Charlemaine a pen in’s hand
! And write to her a loueline
! King. What her is this?
! Laf. Why doctor she: my Lord, there’s one arriu’d,
! If you will see her: now by my faith and honour,
! If seriously I may conuay my thoughts
! In this my light deliuerance, I haue spoke
! With one, that in her sexe, her yeeres, profession,
! Wisedome and constancy, hath amaz’d mee more
! Then I dare blame my weakenesse: will you see her?
! For that is her demand, and know her businesse?
! That done, laugh well at me
! King. Now good Lafew,
! Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
  May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
! By wondring how thou tookst it
! Laf. Nay, Ile fit you,
! And not be all day neither
! King. Thus he his speciall nothing euer prologues
! Laf. Nay, come your waies.
! Enter Hellen.
! King. This haste hath wings indeed
! Laf. Nay, come your waies,
! This is his Maiestie, say your minde to him,
! A Traitor you doe looke like, but such traitors
! His Maiesty seldome feares, I am Cresseds Vncle,
! That dare leaue two together, far you well.
! Enter.
! King. Now faire one, do’s your busines follow vs?
! Hel. I my good Lord,
! Gerard de Narbon was my father,
! In what he did professe, well found
! King. I knew him
! Hel. The rather will I spare my praises towards him,
! Knowing him is enough: on’s bed of death,
! Many receits he gaue me, chieflie one,
! Which as the dearest issue of his practice
! And of his olde experience, th’ onlie darling,
! He bad me store vp, as a triple eye,
! Safer then mine owne two: more deare I haue so,
! And hearing your high Maiestie is toucht
! With that malignant cause, wherein the honour
! Of my deare fathers gift, stands cheefe in power,
! I come to tender it, and my appliance,
! With all bound humblenesse
! King. We thanke you maiden,
  But may not be so credulous of cure,
! When our most learned Doctors leaue vs, and
! The congregated Colledge haue concluded,
! That labouring Art can neuer ransome nature
! From her inaydible estate: I say we must not
! So staine our iudgement, or corrupt our hope,
! To prostitute our past-cure malladie
! To empericks, or to disseuer so
! Our great selfe and our credit, to esteeme
! A sencelesse helpe, when helpe past sence we deeme
! Hell. My dutie then shall pay me for my paines:
! I will no more enforce mine office on you,
! Humbly intreating from your royall thoughts,
! A modest one to beare me backe againe
! King. I cannot giue thee lesse to be cal’d gratefull:
! Thou thoughtst to helpe me, and such thankes I giue,
! As one neere death to those that wish him liue:
! But what at full I know, thou knowst no part,
! I knowing all my perill, thou no Art
! Hell. What I can doe, can doe no hurt to try,
! Since you set vp your rest ‘gainst remedie:
! He that of greatest workes is finisher,
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
! So holy Writ, in babes hath iudgement showne,
! When Iudges haue bin babes; great flouds haue flowne
! From simple sources: and great Seas haue dried
! When Miracles haue by the great’st beene denied.
! Oft expectation failes, and most oft there
! Where most it promises: and oft it hits,
! Where hope is coldest, and despaire most shifts
! King. I must not heare thee, fare thee wel kind maide,
! Thy paines not vs’d, must by thy selfe be paid,
! Proffers not tooke, reape thanks for their reward
! Hel. Inspired Merit so by breath is bard,
! It is not so with him that all things knowes
! As ‘tis with vs, that square our guesse by showes:
! But most it is presumption in vs, when
! The help of heauen we count the act of men.
! Deare sir, to my endeauors giue consent,
! Of heauen, not me, make an experiment.
! I am not an Imposture, that proclaime
! My selfe against the leuill of mine aime,
! But know I thinke, and thinke I know most sure,
! My Art is not past power, nor you past cure
! King. Art thou so confident? Within what space
! Hop’st thou my cure?
! Hel. The greatest grace lending grace,
! Ere twice the horses of the sunne shall bring
! Their fiery torcher his diurnall ring,
! Ere twice in murke and occidentall dampe
! Moist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy Lampe:
! Or foure and twenty times the Pylots glasse
! Hath told the theeuish minutes, how they passe:
! What is infirme, from your sound parts shall flie,
! Health shall liue free, and sickenesse freely dye
! King. Vpon thy certainty and confidence,
! What dar’st thou venter?
! Hell. Taxe of impudence,
! A strumpets boldnesse, a divulged shame
! Traduc’d by odious ballads: my maidens name
! Seard otherwise, ne worse of worst extended
! With vildest torture, let my life be ended
! Kin. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
! His powerfull sound, within an organ weake:
  And what impossibility would slay
! In common sence, sence saues another way:
! Thy life is deere, for all that life can rate
! Worth name of life, in thee hath estimate:
! Youth, beauty, wisedome, courage, all
! That happines and prime, can happy call:
! Thou this to hazard, needs must intimate
! Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate,
! Sweet practiser, thy Physicke I will try,
! That ministers thine owne death if I die
! Hel. If I breake time, or flinch in property
! Of what I spoke, vnpittied let me die,
! And well deseru’d: not helping, death’s my fee,
! But if I helpe, what doe you promise me
! Kin. Make thy demand
! Hel. But will you make it euen?
! Kin. I by my Scepter, and my hopes of helpe
! Hel. Then shalt thou giue me with thy kingly hand
  What husband in thy power I will command:
  Exempted be from me the arrogance
! To choose from forth the royall bloud of France,
  My low and humble name to propagate
! With any branch or image of thy state:
! But such a one thy vassall, whom I know
! Is free for me to aske, thee to bestow
! Kin. Heere is my hand, the premises obseru’d,
! Thy will by my performance shall be seru’d:
! So make the choice of thy owne time, for I
! Thy resolv’d Patient, on thee still relye:
  More should I question thee, and more I must,
! Though more to know, could not be more to trust:
! From whence thou cam’st, how tended on, but rest
! Vnquestion’d welcome, and vndoubted blest.
! Giue me some helpe heere hoa, if thou proceed,
! As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
! Florish. Exit.
! Enter Countesse and Clowne.
! Lady. Come on sir, I shall now put you to the height
! of your breeding
! Clown. I will shew my selfe highly fed, and lowly
! taught, I know my businesse is but to the Court
! Lady. To the Court, why what place make you speciall,
! when you put off that with such contempt, but to
! the Court?
! Clo. Truly Madam, if God haue lent a man any manners,
! hee may easilie put it off at Court: hee that cannot
! make a legge, put off’s cap, kisse his hand, and say nothing,
! has neither legge, hands, lippe, nor cap; and indeed
  such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
! Court, but for me, I haue an answere will serue all men
! Lady. Marry that’s a bountifull answere that fits all
! questions
! Clo. It is like a Barbers chaire that fits all buttockes,
! the pin buttocke, the quatch-buttocke, the brawn buttocke,
! or any buttocke
! Lady. Will your answere serue fit to all questions?
! Clo. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an Atturney,
! as your French Crowne for your taffety punke, as
! Tibs rush for Toms fore-finger, as a pancake for Shroue-tuesday,
! a Morris for May-day, as the naile to his hole,
! the Cuckold to his horne, as a scolding queane to a
! wrangling knaue, as the Nuns lip to the Friers mouth,
! nay as the pudding to his skin
! Lady. Haue you, I say, an answere of such fitnesse for
! all questions?
! Clo. From below your Duke, to beneath your Constable,
! it will fit any question
! Lady. It must be an answere of most monstrous size,
! that must fit all demands
! Clo. But a triflle neither in good faith, if the learned
! should speake truth of it: heere it is, and all that belongs
! to’t. Aske mee if I am a Courtier, it shall doe you no
! harme to learne
! Lady. To be young againe if we could: I will bee a
! foole in question, hoping to bee the wiser by your answer
! La. I pray you sir, are you a Courtier?
! Clo. O Lord sir theres a simple putting off: more,
! more, a hundred of them
! La. Sir I am a poore freind of yours, that loues you
! Clo. O Lord sir, thicke, thicke, spare not me
! La. I thinke sir, you can eate none of this homely
! meate
! Clo. O Lord sir; nay put me too’t, I warrant you
! La. You were lately whipt sir as I thinke
! Clo. O Lord sir, spare not me
! La. Doe you crie O Lord sir at your whipping, and
! spare not me? Indeed your O Lord sir, is very sequent
! to your whipping: you would answere very well to a
! whipping if you were but bound too’t
! Clo. I nere had worse lucke in my life in my O Lord
! sir: I see things may serue long, but not serue euer
! La. I play the noble huswife with the time, to entertaine
! it so merrily with a foole
! Clo. O Lord sir, why there’t serues well agen
! La. And end sir to your businesse: giue Hellen this,
! And vrge her to a present answer backe,
! Commend me to my kinsmen, and my sonne,
! This is not much
! Clo. Not much commendation to them
! La. Not much imployement for you, you vnderstand
! me
! Clo. Most fruitfully, I am there, before my legges
! La. Hast you agen.
! Exeunt.
! Enter Count, Lafew, and Parolles.
! Ol.Laf. They say miracles are past, and we haue our
! Philosophicall persons, to make moderne and familiar
! things supernaturall and causelesse. Hence is it, that we
! make trifles of terrours, ensconcing our selues into seeming
! knowledge, when we should submit our selues to
! an vnknowne feare
! Par. Why ‘tis the rarest argument of wonder, that
! hath shot out in our latter times
! Ros. And so ‘tis
! Ol.Laf. To be relinquisht of the Artists
! Par. So I say both of Galen and Paracelsus
! Ol.Laf. Of all the learned and authenticke fellowes
! Par. Right so I say
! Ol.Laf. That gaue him out incureable
! Par. Why there ‘tis, so say I too
! Ol.Laf. Not to be help’d
! Par. Right, as ‘twere a man assur’d of a-Ol.Laf. Vncertaine life, and sure death
! Par. Iust, you say well: so would I haue said
! Ol.Laf. I may truly say, it is a noueltie to the world
! Par. It is indeede if you will haue it in shewing, you
! shall reade it in what do ye call there
! Ol.Laf. A shewing of a heauenly effect in an earthly
! Actor
! Par. That’s it, I would haue said, the verie same
! Ol.Laf. Why your Dolphin is not lustier: fore mee
! I speake in respect—
! Par. Nay ‘tis strange, ‘tis very straunge, that is the
! breefe and the tedious of it, and he’s of a most facinerious
! spirit, that will not acknowledge it to be the-Ol.Laf. Very hand of heauen
! Par. I, so I say
! Ol.Laf. In a most weake—
! Par. And debile minister great power, great trancendence,
! which should indeede giue vs a further vse to
! be made, then alone the recou’ry of the king, as to bee
! Old Laf. Generally thankfull.
! Enter King, Hellen, and attendants.
! Par. I would haue said it, you say well: heere comes
! the King
! Ol.Laf. Lustique, as the Dutchman saies: Ile like a
! maide the Better whil’st I haue a tooth in my head: why
! he’s able to leade her a Carranto
! Par. Mor du vinager, is not this Helen?
! Ol.Laf. Fore God I thinke so
! King. Goe call before mee all the Lords in Court,
! Sit my preseruer by thy patients side,
! And with this healthfull hand whose banisht sence
! Thou hast repeal’d, a second time receyue
! The confirmation of my promis’d guift,
  Which but attends thy naming.
! Enter 3 or 4 Lords.
! Faire Maide send forth thine eye, this youthfull parcell
! Of Noble Batchellors, stand at my bestowing,
! Ore whom both Soueraigne power, and fathers voice
! I haue to vse; thy franke election make,
! Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake
! Hel. To each of you, one faire and vertuous Mistris;
! Fall when loue please, marry to each but one
! Old Laf. I’de giue bay curtall, and his furniture
! My mouth no more were broken then these boyes,
! And writ as little beard
! King. Peruse them well:
! Not one of those, but had a Noble father.
! She addresses her to a Lord.
! Hel. Gentlemen, heauen hath through me, restor’d
! the king to health
! All. We vnderstand it, and thanke heauen for you
! Hel. I am a simple Maide, and therein wealthiest
! That I protest, I simply am a Maide:
! Please it your Maiestie, I haue done already:
! The blushes in my cheekes thus whisper mee,
! We blush that thou shouldst choose, but be refused;
! Let the white death sit on thy cheeke for euer,
! Wee’l nere come there againe
! King. Make choise and see,
! Who shuns thy loue, shuns all his loue in mee
! Hel. Now Dian from thy Altar do I fly,
! And to imperiall loue, that God most high
! Do my sighes streame: Sir, wil you heare my suite?
! 1.Lo. And grant it
! Hel. Thankes sir, all the rest is mute
! Ol.Laf. I had rather be in this choise, then throw
! Ames-ace for my life
! Hel. The honor sir that flames in your faire eyes,
! Before I speake too threatningly replies:
! Loue make your fortunes twentie times aboue
! Her that so wishes, and her humble loue
! 2.Lo. No better if you please
! Hel. My wish receiue,
! Which great loue grant, and so I take my leaue
! Ol.Laf. Do all they denie her? And they were sons
! of mine, I’de haue them whip’d, or I would send them
! to’th Turke to make Eunuches of
! Hel. Be not afraid that I your hand should take,
! Ile neuer do you wrong for your owne sake:
! Blessing vpon your vowes, and in your bed
! Finde fairer fortune, if you euer wed
! Old Laf. These boyes are boyes of Ice, they’le none
! haue heere: sure they are bastards to the English, the
! French nere got em
! La. You are too young, too happie, and too good
! To make your selfe a sonne out of my blood
! 4.Lord. Faire one, I thinke not so
! Ol.Lord There’s one grape yet, I am sure thy father
! drunke wine. But if thou be’st not an asse, I am a youth
! of fourteene: I haue knowne thee already
! Hel. I dare not say I take you, but I giue
! Me and my seruice, euer whilst I liue
! Into your guiding power: This is the man
! King. Why then young Bertram take her shee’s thy
! wife
! Ber. My wife my Leige? I shal beseech your highnes
! In such a busines, giue me leaue to vse
! The helpe of mine owne eies
! King. Know’st thou not Bertram what shee ha’s
! done for mee?
! Ber. Yes my good Lord, but neuer hope to know
! why I should marrie her
! King. Thou know’st shee ha’s rais’d me from my sickly
! bed
! Ber. But followes it my Lord, to bring me downe
! Must answer for your raising? I knowe her well:
! Shee had her breeding at my fathers charge:
! A poore Physitians daughter my wife? Disdaine
! Rather corrupt me euer
! King. Tis onely title thou disdainst in her, the which
! I can build vp: strange is it that our bloods
! Of colour, waight, and heat, pour’d all together,
! Would quite confound distinction: yet stands off
! In differences so mightie. If she bee
! All that is vertuous (saue what thou dislik’st)
! A poore Phisitians daughter, thou dislik’st
! Of vertue for the name: but doe not so:
! From lowest place, whence vertuous things proceed,
! The place is dignified by th’ doers deede.
! Where great additions swell’s, and vertue none,
! It is a dropsied honour. Good alone,
! Is good without a name? Vilenesse is so:
! The propertie by what is is, should go,
! Not by the title. Shee is young, wise, faire,
! In these, to Nature shee’s immediate heire:
! And these breed honour: that is honours scorne,
! Which challenges it selfe as honours borne,
! And is not like the sire: Honours thriue,
! When rather from our acts we them deriue
! Then our fore-goers: the meere words, a slaue
! Debosh’d on euerie tombe, on euerie graue:
! A lying Trophee, and as oft is dumbe,
! Where dust, and damn’d obliuion is the Tombe.
! Of honour’d bones indeed, what should be saide?
! If thou canst like this creature, as a maide,
! I can create the rest: Vertue, and shee
! Is her owne dower: Honour and wealth, from mee
! Ber. I cannot loue her, nor will striue to doo’t
! King. Thou wrong’st thy selfe, if thou shold’st striue
! to choose
! Hel. That you are well restor’d my Lord, I’me glad:
! Let the rest go
! King. My Honor’s at the stake, which to defeate
! I must produce my power. Heere, take her hand,
! Proud scornfull boy, vnworthie this good gift,
! That dost in vile misprision shackle vp
! My loue, and her desert: that canst not dreame,
! We poizing vs in her defectiue scale,
! Shall weigh thee to the beame: That wilt not know,

! Obey Our will, which trauailes in thy good:
! Beleeue not thy disdaine, but presentlie
! Do thine owne fortunes that obedient right
! Which both thy dutie owes, and Our power claimes,
! Or I will throw thee from my care for euer
! Into the staggers, and the carelesse lapse

! Without all termes of pittie. Speake, thine answer
! Ber. Pardon my gracious Lord: for I submit
! My fancie to your eies, when I consider

! Flies where you bid it: I finde that she which late
! Was in my Nobler thoughts, most base: is now
! The praised of the King, who so ennobled,
! Is as ‘twere borne so
! King. Take her by the hand,
  And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise

! Ber. I take her hand
! Kin. Good fortune, and the fauour of the King
! Smile vpon this Contract: whose Ceremonie
! Shall seeme expedient on the now borne briefe,
! And be perform’d to night: the solemne Feast
! Shall more attend vpon the coming space,
! Expecting absent friends. As thou lou’st her,
! Thy loue’s to me Religious: else, do’s erre.
! Exeunt.
! Parolles and Lafew stay behind, commenting of this wedding.
! Laf. Do you heare Monsieur? A word with you
! Par. Your pleasure sir
! Laf. Your Lord and Master did well to make his recantation
! Par. Recantation? My Lord? my Master?
! Laf. I: Is it not a Language I speake?
! Par. A most harsh one, and not to bee vnderstoode
! without bloudie succeeding. My Master?
! Laf. Are you Companion to the Count Rosillion?
! Par. To any Count, to all Counts: to what is man
! Laf. To what is Counts man: Counts maister is of
! another stile
! Par. You are too old sir: Let it satisfie you, you are
! too old
! Laf. I must tell thee sirrah, I write Man: to which
! title age cannot bring thee
! Par. What I dare too well do, I dare not do
! Laf. I did thinke thee for two ordinaries: to bee a
! prettie wise fellow, thou didst make tollerable vent of
! thy trauell, it might passe: yet the scarffes and the bannerets
! about thee, did manifoldlie disswade me from beleeuing
! thee a vessell of too great a burthen. I haue now
! found thee, when I loose thee againe, I care not: yet art
! thou good for nothing but taking vp, and that th’ourt
! scarce worth
! Par. Hadst thou not the priuiledge of Antiquity vpon
! thee
! Laf. Do not plundge thy selfe to farre in anger, least
! thou hasten thy triall: which if, Lord haue mercie on
! thee for a hen, so my good window of Lettice fare thee
! well, thy casement I neede not open, for I look through
! thee. Giue me thy hand
! Par. My Lord, you giue me most egregious indignity
! Laf. I with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it
! Par. I haue not my Lord deseru’d it
! Laf. Yes good faith, eu’ry dramme of it, and I will
! not bate thee a scruple
! Par. Well, I shall be wiser
! Laf. Eu’n as soone as thou can’st, for thou hast to pull
! at a smacke a’th contrarie. If euer thou bee’st bound
! in thy skarfe and beaten, thou shall finde what it is to be
! proud of thy bondage, I haue a desire to holde my acquaintance
! with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I
! may say in the default, he is a man I know
! Par. My Lord you do me most insupportable vexation
! Laf. I would it were hell paines for thy sake, and my
! poore doing eternall: for doing I am past, as I will by
! thee, in what motion age will giue me leaue.
! Enter.
! Par. Well, thou hast a sonne shall take this disgrace
! off me; scuruy, old, filthy, scuruy Lord: Well, I must
! be patient, there is no fettering of authority. Ile beate
! him (by my life) if I can meete him with any conuenience,
! and he were double and double a Lord. Ile haue
! no more pittie of his age then I would haue of-Ile
! beate him, and if I could but meet him agen.
! Enter Lafew.
! Laf. Sirra, your Lord and masters married, there’s
! newes for you: you haue a new Mistris
! Par. I most vnfainedly beseech your Lordshippe to
! make some reseruation of your wrongs. He is my good
! Lord, whom I serue aboue is my master
! Laf. Who? God
! Par. I sir
! Laf. The deuill it is, that’s thy master. Why dooest
! thou garter vp thy armes a this fashion? Dost make hose
! of thy sleeues? Do other seruants so? Thou wert best set
! thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine Honor,
! if I were but two houres yonger, I’de beate thee: mee-think’st
! thou art a generall offence, and euery man shold
! beate thee: I thinke thou wast created for men to breath
! themselues vpon thee
! Par. This is hard and vndeserued measure my Lord
! Laf. Go too sir, you were beaten in Italy for picking
! a kernell out of a Pomgranat, you are a vagabond, and
! no true traueller: you are more sawcie with Lordes and
! honourable personages, then the Commission of your
! birth and vertue giues you Heraldry. You are not worth
! another word, else I’de call you knaue. I leaue you.
! Exit
! Enter Count Rossillion.
! Par. Good, very good, it is so then: good, very
! good, let it be conceal’d awhile
! Ros. Vndone, and forfeited to cares for euer
! Par. What’s the matter sweet-heart?
! Rossill. Although before the solemne Priest I haue
! sworne, I will not bed her
! Par. What? what sweet heart?
! Ros. O my Parrolles, they haue married me:
! Ile to the Tuscan warres, and neuer bed her
! Par. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits,
! The tread of a mans foot: too’th warres
! Ros. There’s letters from my mother: What th’ import
! is, I know not yet
! Par. I that would be knowne: too’th warrs my boy,
! too’th warres:
! He weares his honor in a boxe vnseene,
! That hugges his kickie wickie heare at home,
! Spending his manlie marrow in her armes
! Which should sustaine the bound and high curuet
! Of Marses fierie steed: to other Regions,
! France is a stable, wee that dwell in’t Iades,
! Therefore too’th warre
! Ros. It shall be so, Ile send her to my house,
  Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
! And wherefore I am fled: Write to the King
! That which I durst not speake. His present gift
! Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
! Where noble fellowes strike: Warres is no strife
! To the darke house, and the detected wife
! Par. Will this Caprichio hold in thee, art sure?
! Ros. Go with me to my chamber, and aduice me.
! Ile send her straight away: To morrow,
! Ile to the warres, she to her single sorrow
! Par. Why these bals bound, ther’s noise in it. Tis hard
! A yong man maried, is a man that’s mard:
! Therefore away, and leaue her brauely: go,
! The King ha’s done you wrong: but hush ‘tis so.

! very merrie, but yet she is not well: but thankes be giuen
! she’s very well, and wants nothing i’th world: but
! yet she is not well
! Hel. If she be verie wel, what do’s she ayle, that she’s
! not verie well?
! Clo. Truly she’s very well indeed, but for two things
! Hel. What two things?
! Clo. One, that she’s not in heauen, whether God send
! her quickly: the other, that she’s in earth, from whence
! God send her quickly.
! Enter Parolles.
! Par. Blesse you my fortunate Ladie
! Hel. I hope sir I haue your good will to haue mine
! owne good fortune
! Par. You had my prayers to leade them on, and to
! keepe them on, haue them still. O my knaue, how do’s
! my old Ladie?
! Clo. So that you had her wrinkles, and I her money,
! I would she did as you say
! Par. Why I say nothing
! Clo. Marry you are the wiser man: for many a mans
! tongue shakes out his masters vndoing: to say nothing,
! to do nothing, to know nothing, and to haue nothing,
! is to be a great part of your title, which is within a verie
! little of nothing
! Par. Away, th’art a knaue
! Clo. You should haue said sir before a knaue, th’art a
! knaue, that’s before me th’art a knaue: this had beene
! truth sir
! Par. Go too, thou art a wittie foole, I haue found
! thee
! Clo. Did you finde me in your selfe sir, or were you
! taught to finde me?
! Clo. The search sir was profitable, and much Foole
! may you find in you, euen to the worlds pleasure, and the
! encrease of laughter
! Par. A good knaue ifaith, and well fed.
! Madam, my Lord will go awaie to night,
! A verie serrious businesse call’s on him:
! The great prerogatiue and rite of loue,
! Which as your due time claimes, he do’s acknowledge,
! But puts it off to a compell’d restraint:
! Whose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets
! Which they distill now in the curbed time,
! To make the comming houre oreflow with ioy,
! And pleasure drowne the brim
! Hel. What’s his will else?
! Par. That you will take your instant leaue a’th king,
! And make this hast as your owne good proceeding,
! Strengthned with what Apologie you thinke
! May make it probable neede
! Hel. What more commands hee?
! Par. That hauing this obtain’d, you presentlie
! Attend his further pleasure
! Hel. In euery thing I waite vpon his will
! Par. I shall report it so.
! Exit Par.
! Hell. I pray you come sirrah.
! Exit
! Enter Lafew and Bertram.
! Laf. But I hope your Lordshippe thinkes not him a

! Ber. Yes my Lord and of verie valiant approofe
! Laf. You haue it from his owne deliuerance
! Ber. And by other warranted testimonie
! Laf. Then my Diall goes not true, I tooke this Larke
! for a bunting
! Ber. I do assure you my Lord he is very great in knowledge,
! and accordinglie valiant
! Laf. I haue then sinn’d against his experience, and
! transgrest against his valour, and my state that way is
! dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent:
! Heere he comes, I pray you make vs freinds, I will pursue
! the amitie.
! Enter Parolles.
! Par. These things shall be done sir

! a verie good Tailor
! Ber. Is shee gone to the king?
! Par. Shee is
! Ber. Will shee away to night?
! Par. As you’le haue her
! Ber. I haue writ my letters, casketted my treasure,
! Giuen order for our horses, and to night,
! When I should take possession of the Bride,
! And ere I doe begin
! Laf. A good Trauailer is something at the latter end
! of a dinner, but on that lies three thirds, and vses a
! known truth to passe a thousand nothings with, should
! bee once hard, and thrice beaten. God saue you Captaine
! Ber. Is there any vnkindnes betweene my Lord and
! you Monsieur?
! Par. I know not how I haue deserued to run into my
! Lords displeasure
! Laf. You haue made shift to run into’t, bootes and
! spurres and all: like him that leapt into the Custard, and
! out of it you’le runne againe, rather then suffer question
! for your residence
! Ber. It may bee you haue mistaken him my Lord
! Laf. And shall doe so euer, though I tooke him at’s
! prayers. Fare you well my Lord, and beleeue this of
! me, there can be no kernell in this light Nut: the soule
! of this man is his cloathes: Trust him not in matter of
! heauie consequence: I haue kept of them tame, & know
! their natures. Farewell Monsieur, I haue spoken better
! of you, then you haue or will to deserue at my hand, but
! we must do good against euill
! Par. An idle Lord, I sweare
! Ber. I thinke so
! Par. Why do you not know him?
! Ber. Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
! Giues him a worthy passe. Heere comes my clog.
! Enter Helena.
! Hel. I haue sir as I was commanded from you
! Spoke with the King, and haue procur’d his leaue
! For present parting, onely he desires
! Some priuate speech with you
! Ber. I shall obey his will.
! You must not meruaile Helen at my course,
  Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
! The ministration, and required office
! On my particular. Prepar’d I was not
! For such a businesse, therefore am I found
! So much vnsetled: This driues me to intreate you,
! That presently you take your way for home,
! And rather muse then aske why I intreate you,
! For my respects are better then they seeme,
! And my appointments haue in them a neede
! Greater then shewes it selfe at the first view,
! To you that know them not. This to my mother,
! ‘Twill be two daies ere I shall see you, so
! I leaue you to your wisedome
! Hel. Sir, I can nothing say,
! But that I am your most obedient seruant
! Ber. Come, come, no more of that
! Hel. And euer shall
! With true obseruance seeke to eeke out that
! Wherein toward me my homely starres haue faild
! To equall my great fortune
! Ber. Let that goe: my hast is verie great. Farwell:
! Hie home
! Hel. Pray sir your pardon
! Ber. Well, what would you say?
! Hel. I am not worthie of the wealth I owe,
! Nor dare I say ‘tis mine: and yet it is,
! But like a timorous theefe, most faine would steale
! What law does vouch mine owne
! Ber. What would you haue?
! Hel. Something, and scarse so much: nothing indeed,
! I would not tell you what I would my Lord: Faith yes,
! Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kisse
! Ber. I pray you stay not, but in hast to horse
! Hel. I shall not breake your bidding, good my Lord:
! Where are my other men? Monsieur, farwell.
! Exit
! Ber. Go thou toward home, where I wil neuer come,
! Whilst I can shake my sword, or heare the drumme:

! Souldiers.
! Duke. So that from point to point, now haue you heard
! The fundamentall reasons of this warre,
  Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
! And more thirsts after
! 1.Lord. Holy seemes the quarrell
! Vpon your Graces part: blacke and fearefull
! On the opposer
! Duke. Therefore we meruaile much our Cosin France
! Would in so iust a businesse, shut his bosome
! Against our borrowing prayers
! French E. Good my Lord,
! The reasons of our state I cannot yeelde,
  But like a common and an outward man,
! That the great figure of a Counsaile frames,
! By selfe vnable motion, therefore dare not
! Say what I thinke of it, since I haue found
! My selfe in my incertaine grounds to faile
! As often as I guest
! Duke. Be it his pleasure
! Fren.G. But I am sure the yonger of our nature,
! That surfet on their ease, will day by day
! Come heere for Physicke
! Duke. Welcome shall they bee:
! And all the honors that can flye from vs,
! Shall on them settle: you know your places well,
! When better fall, for your auailes they fell,
! To morrow to’th the field.
! Flourish.
! Enter Countesse and Clowne.
! Count. It hath happen’d all, as I would haue had it, saue
! that he comes not along with her
! Clo. By my troth I take my young Lord to be a verie
! melancholly man
! Count. By what obseruance I pray you
! Clo. Why he will looke vppon his boote, and sing:
! mend the Ruffe and sing, aske questions and sing, picke
! his teeth, and sing: I know a man that had this tricke of
! melancholy hold a goodly Mannor for a song
! Lad. Let me see what he writes, and when he meanes
! to come
! Clow. I haue no minde to Isbell since I was at Court.
! Our old Lings, and our Isbels a’th Country, are nothing
! like your old Ling and your Isbels a’th Court: the brains
! of my Cupid’s knock’d out, and I beginne to loue, as an
! old man loues money, with no stomacke

! Clo. In that you haue there.
! Exit

! This is not well rash and vnbridled boy,
! To flye the fauours of so good a King,
! To plucke his indignation on thy head,
! By the misprising of a Maide too vertuous
! For the contempt of Empire.
! Enter Clowne.
! Clow. O Madam, yonder is heauie newes within betweene
! two souldiers, and my yong Ladie
! La. What is the matter
! Clo. Nay there is some comfort in the newes, some
! comfort, your sonne will not be kild so soone as I thoght
! he would
! La. Why should he be kill’d?
! Clo. So say I Madame, if he runne away, as I heare he
! does, the danger is in standing too’t, that’s the losse of
! men, though it be the getting of children. Heere they
! come will tell you more. For my part I onely heare your
! sonne was run away.
! Enter Hellen and two Gentlemen.
! French E. Saue you good Madam
! Hel. Madam, my Lord is gone, for euer gone
! French G. Do not say so
! La. Thinke vpon patience, pray you Gentlemen,
! I haue felt so many quirkes of ioy and greefe,
! That the first face of neither on the start
! Can woman me vntoo’t. Where is my sonne I pray you?
! Fren.G. Madam he’s gone to serue the Duke of Florence,
! We met him thitherward, for thence we came:
! And after some dispatch in hand at Court,
! Thither we bend againe
! Hel. Looke on his Letter Madam, here’s my Pasport.

! Old La. I prethee Ladie haue a better cheere,
! If thou engrossest, all the greefes are thine,

  But I do wash his name out of my blood,
! And thou art all my childe. Towards Florence is he?
! Fren.G. I Madam
! La. And to be a souldier
! Fren.G. Such is his noble purpose, and beleeu’t
! The Duke will lay vpon him all the honor
! That good conuenience claimes
! La. Returne you thither
! Fren.E. I Madam, with the swiftest wing of speed
! Hel. Till I haue no wife, I haue nothing in France,
! ‘Tis bitter
! La. Finde you that there?
! Hel. I Madame
! Fren.E. ‘Tis but the boldnesse of his hand haply, which
! his heart was not consenting too
! Lad. Nothing in France, vntill he haue no wife:
! There’s nothing heere that is too good for him
! But onely she, and she deserues a Lord
! That twenty such rude boyes might tend vpon,
! And call her hourely Mistris. Who was with him?
! Fren.E. A seruant onely, and a Gentleman: which I
! haue sometime knowne
! La. Parolles was it not?
! Fren.E. I my good Ladie, hee
! La. A verie tainted fellow, and full of wickednesse,
! My sonne corrupts a well deriued nature
! With his inducement
! Fren.E. Indeed good Ladie the fellow has a deale of
! that, too much, which holds him much to haue
! La. Y’are welcome Gentlemen, I will intreate you
! when you see my sonne, to tell him that his sword can
! neuer winne the honor that he looses: more Ile intreate

! Fren.G. We serue you Madam in that and all your
! worthiest affaires
! La. Not so, but as we change our courtesies,
! Will you draw neere?
! Enter.
! Hel. Till I haue no wife I haue nothing in France.
! Nothing in France vntill he has no wife:
! Thou shalt haue none Rossillion, none in France,
! Then hast thou all againe: poore Lord, is’t I
! That chase thee from thy Countrie, and expose
! Those tender limbes of thine, to the euent
! Of the none-sparing warre? And is it I,
! That driue thee from the sportiue Court, where thou
! Was’t shot at with faire eyes, to be the marke
! Of smoakie Muskets? O you leaden messengers,
! That ride vpon the violent speede of fire,
! Fly with false ayme, moue the still-peering aire
! That sings with piercing, do not touch my Lord:
! Who euer shoots at him, I set him there.
! Who euer charges on his forward brest
! I am the Caitiffe that do hold him too’t,
! And though I kill him not, I am the cause
! His death was so effected: Better ‘twere
! I met the rauine Lyon when he roar’d
! With sharpe constraint of hunger: better ‘twere,
  That all the miseries which nature owes
! Were mine at once. No come thou home Rossillion,
! Whence honor but of danger winnes a scarre,

! Whom I my selfe embrace, to set him free.
! Ah what sharpe stings are in her mildest words?

! Ste. Pardon me Madam,

! a filthy Officer he is in those suggestions for the young
! Earle, beware of them Diana; their promises, entisements,
! oathes, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are
! not the things they go vnder: many a maide hath beene

! terrible shewes in the wracke of maiden-hood, cannot

! with the twigges that threatens them. I hope I neede

! I will conduct you where you shall be lodg’d,
! The rather for I thinke I know your hostesse
! As ample as my selfe
! Hel. Is it your selfe?
! Wid. If you shall please so Pilgrime
! Hel. I thanke you, and will stay vpon your leisure
! Wid. You came I thinke from France?
! Hel. I did so
! Wid. Heere you shall see a Countriman of yours
! That has done worthy seruice
! Hel. His name I pray you?
! Dia. The Count Rossillion: know you such a one?
! Hel. But by the eare that heares most nobly of him:
! His face I know not
! Dia. What somere he is
! He’s brauely taken heere. He stole from France
! As ‘tis reported: for the King had married him
! Against his liking. Thinke you it is so?
! Hel. I surely meere the truth, I know his Lady
! Dia. There is a Gentleman that serues the Count,
! Reports but coursely of her
! Hel. What’s his name?
! Dia. Monsieur Parrolles
! Hel. Oh I beleeue with him,
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
! Of the great Count himselfe, she is too meane
! To haue her name repeated, all her deseruing
! Is a reserued honestie, and that
! I haue not heard examin’d
! Dian. Alas poore Ladie,
  ‘Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
! Of a detesting Lord
! Wid. I write good creature, wheresoere she is,
! Her hart waighes sadly: this yong maid might do her
! A shrewd turne if she pleas’d
! Hel. How do you meane?
! May be the amorous Count solicites her
! In the vnlawfull purpose
! Wid. He does indeede,
! And brokes with all that can in such a suite
! Corrupt the tender honour of a Maide:
! But she is arm’d for him, and keepes her guard
  In honestest defence.
! Drumme and Colours. Enter Count Rossillion, Parrolles, and the
! whole
! Armie.
! Mar. The goddes forbid else
! Wid. So, now they come:
! That is Anthonio the Dukes eldest sonne,
! That Escalus
! Hel. Which is the Frenchman?
! Dia. Hee,
! That with the plume, ‘tis a most gallant fellow,
! I would he lou’d his wife: if he were honester
! He were much goodlier. Is’t not a handsom Gentleman
! Hel. I like him well
! Di. ‘Tis pitty he is not honest: yonds that same knaue
! That leades him to these places: were I his Ladie,
! I would poison that vile Rascall
! Hel. Which is he?
! Dia. That Iacke-an-apes with scarfes. Why is hee
! melancholly?
! Hel. Perchance he’s hurt i’th battaile
! Par. Loose our drum? Well
! Mar. He’s shrewdly vext at something. Looke he
! has spyed vs
! Wid. Marrie hang you
! Mar. And your curtesie, for a ring-carrier.
! Enter.
! Wid. The troope is past: Come pilgrim, I wil bring
! you, Where you shall host: Of inioyn’d penitents
! There’s foure or fiue, to great S[aint]. Iaques bound,
! Alreadie at my house
! Hel. I humbly thanke you:
! Please it this Matron, and this gentle Maide
! To eate with vs to night, the charge and thanking
! Shall be for me, and to requite you further,
! I will bestow some precepts of this Virgin,
! Worthy the note
! Both. Wee’l take your offer kindly.
! Exeunt.
! Enter Count Rossillion and the Frenchmen, as at first.
! Cap.E. Nay good my Lord put him too’t: let him
! haue his way
! Cap.G. If your Lordshippe finde him not a Hilding,
! hold me no more in your respect
! Cap.E. On my life my Lord, a bubble
! Ber. Do you thinke I am so farre
! Deceiued in him
! Cap.E. Beleeue it my Lord, in mine owne direct
! knowledge, without any malice, but to speake of him
! as my kinsman, hee’s a most notable Coward, an infinite
! and endlesse Lyar, an hourely promise-breaker, the
! owner of no one good qualitie, worthy your Lordships
! entertainment
! Cap.G. It were fit you knew him, least reposing too
! farre in his vertue which he hath not, he might at some
! great and trustie businesse, in a maine daunger, fayle
! you
! Ber. I would I knew in what particular action to try
! him
! Cap.G. None better then to let him fetch off his
! drumme, which you heare him so confidently vndertake
! to do
! C.E. I with a troop of Florentines wil sodainly surprize
! him; such I will haue whom I am sure he knowes
! not from the enemie: wee will binde and hoodwinke
! him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried
! into the Leager of the aduersaries, when we bring
! him to our owne tents: be but your Lordship present
! at his examination, if he do not for the promise of his
! life, and in the highest compulsion of base feare, offer to
! betray you, and deliuer all the intelligence in his power
! against you, and that with the diuine forfeite of his
! soule vpon oath, neuer trust my iudgement in anie
! thing
! Cap.G. O for the loue of laughter, let him fetch his
! drumme, he sayes he has a stratagem for’t: when your
! Lordship sees the bottome of this successe in’t, and to
! what mettle this counterfeyt lump of ours will be melted
! if you giue him not Iohn drummes entertainement,
! your inclining cannot be remoued. Heere he comes.
! Enter Parrolles.
! Cap.E. O for the loue of laughter hinder not the honor
! of his designe, let him fetch off his drumme in any
! hand
! Ber. How now Monsieur? This drumme sticks sorely
! in your disposition
! Cap.G. A pox on’t, let it go, ‘tis but a drumme
! Par. But a drumme: Ist but a drumme? A drum so
! lost. There was excellent command, to charge in with
! our horse vpon our owne wings, and to rend our owne
! souldiers
! Cap.G. That was not to be blam’d in the command
! of the seruice: it was a disaster of warre that C�sar him
! selfe could not haue preuented, if he had beene there to
! command
! Ber. Well, wee cannot greatly condemne our successe:
! some dishonor wee had in the losse of that drum,
! but it is not to be recouered
! Par. It might haue beene recouered
! Ber. It might, but it is not now
! Par. It is to be recouered, but that the merit of seruice
! is sildome attributed to the true and exact performer,
! I would haue that drumme or another, or hic iacet
! Ber. Why if you haue a stomacke, too’t Monsieur: if
! you thinke your mysterie in stratagem, can bring this
! instrument of honour againe into his natiue quarter, be
! magnanimious in the enterprize and go on, I wil grace
! the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speede well in
! it, the Duke shall both speake of it, and extend to you
! what further becomes his greatnesse, euen to the vtmost
! syllable of your worthinesse
! Par. By the hand of a souldier I will vndertake it
! Ber. But you must not now slumber in it
! Par. Ile about it this euening, and I will presently
! pen downe my dilemma’s, encourage my selfe in my
! certaintie, put my selfe into my mortall preparation:
! and by midnight looke to heare further from me
! Ber. May I bee bold to acquaint his grace you are
! gone about it
! Par. I know not what the successe wil be my Lord,
! but the attempt I vow
! Ber. I know th’art valiant,
! And to the possibility of thy souldiership,
! Will subscribe for thee: Farewell
! Par. I loue not many words.
! Exit
! Cap.E. No more then a fish loues water. Is not this
! a strange fellow my Lord, that so confidently seemes to
! vndertake this businesse, which he knowes is not to be
! done, damnes himselfe to do, & dares better be damnd
! then to doo’t
! Cap.G. You do not know him my Lord as we doe,
! certaine it is that he will steale himselfe into a mans fauour,
! and for a weeke escape a great deale of discoueries,
! but when you finde him out, you haue him euer after
! Ber. Why do you thinke he will make no deede at
! all of this that so seriouslie hee dooes addresse himselfe
! vnto?
! Cap.E. None in the world, but returne with an inuention,
! and clap vpon you two or three probable lies:
! but we haue almost imbost him, you shall see his fall to
! night; for indeede he is not for your Lordshippes respect
! Cap.G. Weele make you some sport with the Foxe
! ere we case him. He was first smoak’d by the old Lord
! Lafew, when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what
! a sprat you shall finde him, which you shall see this verie
! night
! Cap.E. I must go looke my twigges,
! He shall be caught
! Ber. Your brother he shall go along with me
! Cap.G. As’t please your Lordship, Ile leaue you
! Ber. Now wil I lead you to the house, and shew you
! The Lasse I spoke of
! Cap.E. But you say she’s honest
! Ber. That’s all the fault: I spoke with hir but once,
! And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her
! By this same Coxcombe that we haue i’th winde
! Tokens and Letters, which she did resend,
! And this is all I haue done: She’s a faire creature,
  Will you go see her?
! Cap.E. With all my heart my Lord.
! Exeunt.
! Enter Hellen, and Widdow.
! Hel. If you misdoubt me that I am not shee,
  I know not how I shall assure you further,
! But I shall loose the grounds I worke vpon
! Wid. Though my estate be falne, I was well borne,
! Nothing acquainted with these businesses,
  And would not put my reputation now
! In any staining act
! Hel. Nor would I wish you.
! First giue me trust, the Count he is my husband,
! And what to your sworne counsaile I haue spoken,
! Is so from word to word: and then you cannot
! By the good ayde that I of you shall borrow,
! Erre in bestowing it
! Wid. I should beleeue you,
! For you haue shew’d me that which well approues
! Y’are great in fortune
! Hel. Take this purse of Gold,
! And let me buy your friendly helpe thus farre,
! Which I will ouer-pay, and pay againe
! When I haue found it. The Count he woes your
! daughter,
! Layes downe his wanton siedge before her beautie,
! Resolue to carrie her: let her in fine consent
! As wee’l direct her how ‘tis best to beare it:
! Now his important blood will naught denie,
! That shee’l demand: a ring the Countie weares,
  That downward hath succeeded in his house
! From sonne to sonne, some foure or fiue discents,
! Since the first father wore it. This Ring he holds
! In most rich choice: yet in his idle fire,
! To buy his will, it would not seeme too deere,
! How ere repented after
! Wid. Now I see the bottome of your purpose
! Hel. You see it lawfull then, it is no more,
! But that your daughter ere she seemes as wonne,
! Desires this Ring; appoints him an encounter;
! In fine, deliuers me to fill the time,
! Her selfe most chastly absent: after
! To marry her, Ile adde three thousand Crownes
! To what is past already
! Wid. I haue yeelded:
! Instruct my daughter how she shall perseuer,
! That time and place with this deceite so lawfull
! May proue coherent. Euery night he comes
! With Musickes of all sorts, and songs compos’d
! To her vnworthinesse: It nothing steeds vs
! To chide him from our eeues, for he persists
! As if his life lay on’t
! Hel. Why then to night
! Let vs assay our plot, which if it speed,
! Is wicked meaning in a lawfull deede;
! And lawfull meaning in a lawfull act,
! Where both not sinne, and yet a sinfull fact.
  But let’s about it.
! Actus Quartus.
! Enter one of the Frenchmen, with fiue or sixe other souldiers in
! ambush.
! Lord E. He can come no other way but by this hedge
! corner: when you sallie vpon him, speake what terrible
! Language you will: though you vnderstand it not your
! selues, no matter: for we must not seeme to vnderstand
! him, vnlesse some one among vs, whom wee must produce
! for an Interpreter
! 1.Sol. Good Captaine, let me be th’ Interpreter
! Lor.E. Art not acquainted with him? knowes he not
! thy voice?
! 1.Sol. No sir I warrant you
! Lo.E. But what linsie wolsy hast thou to speake to vs
! againe
! 1.Sol. E’n such as you speake to me
! Lo.E. He must thinke vs some band of strangers, i’th
! aduersaries entertainment. Now he hath a smacke of all
! neighbouring Languages: therefore we must euery one
! be a man of his owne fancie, not to know what we speak
! one to another: so we seeme to know, is to know straight
! our purpose: Choughs language, gabble enough, and
! good enough. As for you interpreter, you must seeme
! very politicke. But couch hoa, heere hee comes, to beguile
! two houres in a sleepe, and then to returne & swear
! the lies he forges.
! Enter Parrolles.
! Par. Ten a clocke: Within these three houres ‘twill
! be time enough to goe home. What shall I say I haue
! done? It must bee a very plausiue inuention that carries
! it. They beginne to smoake mee, and disgraces haue of
! late, knock’d too often at my doore: I finde my tongue
! is too foole-hardie, but my heart hath the feare of Mars
! before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of
! my tongue
! Lo.E. This is the first truth that ere thine own tongue
! was guiltie of
! Par. What the diuell should moue mee to vndertake
! the recouerie of this drumme, being not ignorant of the
  impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
! must giue my selfe some hurts, and say I got them in exploit:
! yet slight ones will not carrie it. They will say,
! came you off with so little? And great ones I dare not
! giue, wherefore what’s the instance. Tongue, I must put
! you into a Butter-womans mouth, and buy my selfe another
! of Baiazeths Mule, if you prattle mee into these
! perilles
! Lo.E. Is it possible he should know what hee is, and
! be that he is
! Par. I would the cutting of my garments wold serue
! the turne, or the breaking of my Spanish sword
! Lo.E. We cannot affoord you so
! Par. Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in
! stratagem
! Lo.E. ‘Twould not do
! Par. Or to drowne my cloathes, and say I was stript
! Lo.E. Hardly serue
! Par. Though I swore I leapt from the window of the
! Citadell
! Lo.E. How deepe?
! Par. Thirty fadome
! Lo.E. Three great oathes would scarse make that be
! beleeued
! Par. I would I had any drumme of the enemies, I
! would sweare I recouer’d it
! Lo.E. You shall heare one anon
! Par. A drumme now of the enemies.
! Alarum within.
! Lo.E. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo
! All. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo
! Par. O ransome, ransome,
! Do not hide mine eyes
! Inter. Boskos thromuldo boskos
! Par. I know you are the Muskos Regiment,
! And I shall loose my life for want of language.
! If there be heere German or Dane, Low Dutch,
! Italian, or French, let him speake to me,
! Ile discouer that, which shal vndo the Florentine
! Int. Boskos vauvado, I vnderstand thee, & can speake
! thy tongue: Kerelybonto sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
! seuenteene ponyards are at thy bosome
! Par. Oh
! Inter. Oh pray, pray, pray,
! Manka reuania dulche
! Lo.E. Oscorbidulchos voliuorco
! Int. The Generall is content to spare thee yet,
! And hoodwinkt as thou art, will leade thee on
! To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst informe
! Something to saue thy life
! Par. O let me liue,
! And all the secrets of our campe Ile shew,
! Their force, their purposes: Nay, Ile speake that,
! Which you will wonder at
! Inter. But wilt thou faithfully?
! Par. If I do not, damne me
! Inter. Acordo linta.
! Come on, thou are granted space.
! Exit
! A short Alarum within.
! L.E. Go tell the Count Rossillion and my brother,
! We haue caught the woodcocke, and will keepe him mufled
! Till we do heare from them
! Sol. Captaine I will
! L.E. A will betray vs all vnto our selues,
! Informe on that
! Sol. So I will sir
! L.E. Till then Ile keepe him darke and safely lockt.
! Exit
! Enter Bertram, and the Maide called Diana.
! Ber. They told me that your name was Fontybell
! Dia. No my good Lord, Diana
! Ber. Titled Goddesse,
! And worth it with addition: but faire soule,
! In your fine frame hath loue no qualitie?
! If the quicke fire of youth light not your minde,
! You are no Maiden but a monument
! When you are dead you should be such a one
! As you are now: for you are cold and sterne,
  And now you should be as your mother was
! When your sweet selfe was got
! Dia. She then was honest
! Ber. So should you be
! Dia. No:
! My mother did but dutie, such (my Lord)
! As you owe to your wife
! Ber. No more a’that:
! I prethee do not striue against my vowes:
! I was compell’d to her, but I loue thee
! By loues owne sweet constraint, and will for euer
! Do thee all rights of seruice
! Dia. I so you serue vs
! Till we serue you: But when you haue our Roses,
! You barely leaue our thornes to pricke our selues,
! And mocke vs with our barenesse
! Ber. How haue I sworne
! Dia. Tis not the many oathes that makes the truth,
! But the plaine single vow, that is vow’d true:
! What is not holie, that we sweare not by,
! But take the high’st to witnesse: then pray you tell me,
! If I should sweare by Ioues great attributes,
! I lou’d you deerely, would you beleeue my oathes,
! When I did loue you ill? This ha’s no holding
! To sweare by him whom I protest to loue
! That I will worke against him. Therefore your oathes
! Are words and poore conditions, but vnseal’d
! At lest in my opinion
! Ber. Change it, change it:
! Be not so holy cruell: Loue is holie,
! And my integritie ne’re knew the crafts
! That you do charge men with: Stand no more off,
! But giue thy selfe vnto my sicke desires,
! Who then recouers. Say thou art mine, and euer
! My loue as it beginnes, shall so perseuer
! Dia. I see that men make rope’s in such a scarre,
! That wee’l forsake our selues. Giue me that Ring
! Ber. Ile lend it thee my deere; but haue no power
! To giue it from me
! Dia. Will you not my Lord?
! Ber. It is an honour longing to our house,
! Bequeathed downe from manie Ancestors,
! Which were the greatest obloquie i’th world,
! In me to loose
! Dian. Mine Honors such a Ring,
! My chastities the Iewell of our house,
! Bequeathed downe from many Ancestors,
! Which were the greatest obloquie i’th world,
! In mee to loose. Thus your owne proper wisedome
! Brings in the Champion honor on my part,
! Against your vaine assault
! Ber. Heere, take my Ring,
! My house, mine honor, yea my life be thine,
! And Ile be bid by thee
! Dia. When midnight comes, knocke at my chamber
! window:
! Ile order take, my mother shall not heare.
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
! When you haue conquer’d my yet maiden-bed,
! Remaine there but an houre, nor speake to mee:
! My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them,
! When backe againe this Ring shall be deliuer’d:
! And on your finger in the night, Ile put
! Another Ring, that what in time proceeds,
! May token to the future, our past deeds.
! Adieu till then, then faile not: you haue wonne
! A wife of me, though there my hope be done
! Ber. A heauen on earth I haue won by wooing thee
! Di. For which, liue long to thank both heauen & me,
  You may so in the end.
! My mother told me iust how he would woo,
! As if she sate in’s heart. She sayes, all men
! Haue the like oathes: He had sworne to marrie me
! When his wife’s dead: therfore Ile lye with him
! When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braide,
! Marry that will, I liue and die a Maid:
! Onely in this disguise, I think’t no sinne,
! To cosen him that would vniustly winne.
! Exit
! Enter the two French Captaines, and some two or three Souldiours.
! Cap.G. You haue not giuen him his mothers letter
! Cap.E. I haue deliu’red it an houre since, there is som
! thing in’t that stings his nature: for on the reading it,
! he chang’d almost into another man
! Cap.G. He has much worthy blame laid vpon him,
! for shaking off so good a wife, and so sweet a Lady
! Cap.E. Especially, hee hath incurred the euerlasting
! displeasure of the King, who had euen tun’d his bounty
! to sing happinesse to him. I will tell you a thing, but
! you shall let it dwell darkly with you
! Cap.G. When you haue spoken it ‘tis dead, and I am
! the graue of it
! Cap.E. Hee hath peruerted a young Gentlewoman
! heere in Florence, of a most chaste renown, & this night
! he fleshes his will in the spoyle of her honour: hee hath
! giuen her his monumentall Ring, and thinkes himselfe
! made in the vnchaste composition
! Cap.G. Now God delay our rebellion as we are our
! selues, what things are we
! Cap.E. Meerely our owne traitours. And as in the
! common course of all treasons, we still see them reueale
! themselues, till they attaine to their abhorr’d ends: so
! he that in this action contriues against his owne Nobility
! in his proper streame, oreflowes himselfe
! Cap.G. Is it not meant damnable in vs, to be Trumpeters
! of our vnlawfull intents? We shall not then haue
! his company to night?
! Cap.E. Not till after midnight: for hee is dieted to
! his houre
! Cap.G. That approaches apace: I would gladly haue
! him see his company anathomiz’d, that hee might take
! a measure of his owne iudgements, wherein so curiously
! he had set this counterfeit
! Cap.E. We will not meddle with him till he come;
! for his presence must be the whip of the other
! Cap.G. In the meane time, what heare you of these
! Warres?
! Cap.E. I heare there is an ouerture of peace
! Cap.G. Nay, I assure you a peace concluded
! Cap.E. What will Count Rossillion do then? Will he
! trauaile higher, or returne againe into France?
! Cap.G. I perceiue by this demand, you are not altogether
! of his councell
! Cap.E. Let it be forbid sir, so should I bee a great
! deale of his act
! Cap.G. Sir, his wife some two months since fledde
! from his house, her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Iaques
! le grand; which holy vndertaking, with most austere
! sanctimonie she accomplisht: and there residing,
! the tendernesse of her Nature, became as a prey to her
! greefe: in fine, made a groane of her last breath, & now
! she sings in heauen
! Cap.E. How is this iustified?
! Cap.G. The stronger part of it by her owne Letters,
! which makes her storie true, euen to the poynt of her
! death: her death it selfe, which could not be her office
! to say, is come: was faithfully confirm’d by the Rector
! of the place
! Cap.E. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
! Cap.G. I, and the particular confirmations, point
! from point, to the full arming of the veritie
! Cap.E. I am heartily sorrie that hee’l bee gladde of
! this
! Cap.G. How mightily sometimes, we make vs comforts
! of our losses
! Cap.E. And how mightily some other times, wee
! drowne our gaine in teares, the great dignitie that his
! valour hath here acquir’d for him, shall at home be encountred
! with a shame as ample
! Cap.G. The webbe of our life, is of a mingled yarne,
! good and ill together: our vertues would bee proud, if
! our faults whipt them not, and our crimes would dispaire
! if they were not cherish’d by our vertues.
! Enter a Messenger.
! How now? Where’s your master?
! Ser. He met the Duke in the street sir, of whom hee
! hath taken a solemne leaue: his Lordshippe will next
! morning for France. The Duke hath offered him Letters
! of commendations to the King
! Cap.E. They shall bee no more then needfull there,
! if they were more then they can commend.
! Enter Count Rossillion.
! Ber. They cannot be too sweete for the Kings tartnesse,
! heere’s his Lordship now. How now my Lord,
! i’st not after midnight?
! Ber. I haue to night dispatch’d sixteene businesses, a
! moneths length a peece, by an abstract of successe: I
! haue congied with the Duke, done my adieu with his
! neerest; buried a wife, mourn’d for her, writ to my Ladie
! mother, I am returning, entertain’d my Conuoy, &
! betweene these maine parcels of dispatch, affected many
! nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I haue
! not ended yet
! Cap.E. If the businesse bee of any difficulty, and this
! morning your departure hence, it requires hast of your
! Lordship
! Ber. I meane the businesse is not ended, as fearing
! to heare of it hereafter: but shall we haue this dialogue
! betweene the Foole and the Soldiour. Come, bring
! forth this counterfet module, ha’s deceiu’d mee, like a
! double-meaning Prophesier
! Cap.E. Bring him forth, ha’s sate i’th stockes all night
! poore gallant knaue
! Ber. No matter, his heeles haue deseru’d it, in vsurping
! his spurres so long. How does he carry himselfe?
! Cap.E. I haue told your Lordship alreadie: The
! stockes carrie him. But to answer you as you would be
! vnderstood, hee weepes like a wench that had shed her
! milke, he hath confest himselfe to Morgan, whom hee
! supposes to be a Friar, fro[m] the time of his remembrance
! to this very instant disaster of his setting i’th stockes:
! and what thinke you he hath confest?
! Ber. Nothing of me, ha’s a?
! Cap.E. His confession is taken, and it shall bee read
! to his face, if your Lordshippe be in’t, as I beleeue you
! are, you must haue the patience to heare it.
! Enter Parolles with his Interpreter.
! Ber. A plague vpon him, muffeld; he can say nothing
! of me: hush, hush
! Cap.G. Hoodman comes: Portotartarossa
! Inter. He calles for the tortures, what will you say
! without em
! Par. I will confesse what I know without constraint,
! If ye pinch me like a Pasty, I can say no more
! Int. Bosko Chimurcho
! Cap. Boblibindo chicurmurco
! Int. You are a mercifull Generall: Our Generall
! bids you answer to what I shall aske you out of a Note
! Par. And truly, as I hope to liue
! Int. First demand of him, how many horse the Duke
! is strong. What say you to that?
! Par. Fiue or sixe thousand, but very weake and vnseruiceable:
! the troopes are all scattered, and the Commanders
! verie poore rogues, vpon my reputation and
! credit, and as I hope to liue
! Int. Shall I set downe your answer so?
! Par. Do, Ile take the Sacrament on’t, how & which
! way you will: all’s one to him
! Ber. What a past-sauing slaue is this?
! Cap.G. Y’are deceiu’d my Lord, this is Mounsieur
! Parrolles the gallant militarist, that was his owne phrase
! that had the whole theoricke of warre in the knot of his
! scarfe, and the practise in the chape of his dagger
! Cap.E. I will neuer trust a man againe, for keeping
! his sword cleane, nor beleeue he can haue euerie thing
! in him, by wearing his apparrell neatly
! Int. Well, that’s set downe
! Par. Fiue or six thousand horse I sed, I will say true,
! or thereabouts set downe, for Ile speake truth
! Cap.G. He’s very neere the truth in this
! Ber. But I con him no thankes for’t in the nature he
! deliuers it
! Par. Poore rogues, I pray you say
! Int. Well, that’s set downe
! Par. I humbly thanke you sir, a truth’s a truth, the
! Rogues are maruailous poore
! Interp. Demaund of him of what strength they are a
! foot. What say you to that?
! Par. By my troth sir, if I were to liue this present
! houre, I will tell true. Let me see, Spurio a hundred &
! fiftie, Sebastian so many, Corambus so many, Iaques so
! many: Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowicke, and Gratij, two hundred
! fiftie each: Mine owne Company, Chitopher, Vaumond,
! Bentij, two hundred fiftie each: so that the muster
! file, rotten and sound, vppon my life amounts not to fifteene
! thousand pole, halfe of the which, dare not shake
! the snow from off their Cassockes, least they shake themselues
! to peeces
! Ber. What shall be done to him?
! Cap.G. Nothing, but let him haue thankes. Demand
! of him my condition: and what credite I haue with the
! Duke
! Int. Well that’s set downe: you shall demaund of
! him, whether one Captaine Dumaine bee i’th Campe, a
! Frenchman: what his reputation is with the Duke, what
! his valour, honestie, and expertnesse in warres: or whether
! he thinkes it were not possible with well-waighing
! summes of gold to corrupt him to a reuolt. What say you
! to this? What do you know of it?
! Par. I beseech you let me answer to the particular of
! the intergatories. Demand them singly
! Int. Do you know this Captaine Dumaine?
! Par. I know him, a was a Botchers Prentize in Paris,
! from whence he was whipt for getting the Shrieues fool
! with childe, a dumbe innocent that could not say him
! nay
! Ber. Nay, by your leaue hold your hands, though I
! know his braines are forfeite to the next tile that fals
! Int. Well, is this Captaine in the Duke of Florences
! campe?
! Par. Vpon my knowledge he is, and lowsie
! Cap.G. Nay looke not so vpon me: we shall heare of
! your Lord anon
! Int. What is his reputation with the Duke?
! Par. The Duke knowes him for no other, but a poore
! Officer of mine, and writ to mee this other day, to turne
! him out a’th band. I thinke I haue his Letter in my pocket
! Int. Marry we’ll search
! Par. In good sadnesse I do not know, either it is there,
! or it is vpon a file with the Dukes other Letters, in my
! Tent
! Int. Heere ‘tis, heere’s a paper, shall I reade it to you?
! Par. I do not know if it be it or no
! Ber. Our Interpreter do’s it well
! Cap.G. Excellently
! Int. Dian, the Counts a foole, and full of gold
! Par. That is not the Dukes letter sir: that is an aduertisement
! to a proper maide in Florence, one Diana, to
! take heede of the allurement of one Count Rossillion, a
! foolish idle boy: but for all that very ruttish. I pray you
! sir put it vp againe
! Int. Nay, Ile reade it first by your fauour
! Par. My meaning in’t I protest was very honest in the
! behalfe of the maid: for I knew the young Count to be a
! dangerous and lasciuious boy, who is a whale to Virginity,
! and deuours vp all the fry it finds
! Ber. Damnable both-sides rogue
! Int.
! Let.
! When he sweares oathes, bid him drop gold, and
! take it:
! After he scores, he neuer payes the score:
! Halfe won is match well made, match and well make it,
! He nere payes after-debts, take it before,
! And say a souldier (Dian) told thee this:
! Men are to mell with, boyes are not to kis.
! For count of this, the Counts a Foole I know it,
! Who payes before, but not when he does owe it.
! Thine as he vow’d to thee in thine eare,
! Parolles
! Ber. He shall be whipt through the Armie with this
! rime in’s forehead
! Cap.E. This is your deuoted friend sir, the manifold
! Linguist, and the army-potent souldier
! Ber. I could endure any thing before but a Cat, and
! now he’s a Cat to me
! Int. I perceiue sir by your Generals lookes, wee shall
! be faine to hang you
! Par. My life sir in any case: Not that I am afraide to
! dye, but that my offences beeing many, I would repent
! out the remainder of Nature. Let me liue sir in a dungeon,
! i’th stockes, or any where, so I may liue
! Int. Wee’le see what may bee done, so you confesse
! freely: therefore once more to this Captaine Dumaine:
! you haue answer’d to his reputation with the Duke, and
! to his valour. What is his honestie?
! Par. He will steale sir an Egge out of a Cloister: for
! rapes and rauishments he paralels Nessus. Hee professes
! not keeping of oaths, in breaking em he is stronger then
! Hercules. He will lye sir, with such volubilitie, that you
! would thinke truth were a foole: drunkennesse is his best
! vertue, for he will be swine-drunke, and in his sleepe he
! does little harme, saue to his bed-cloathes about him:
! but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I
! haue but little more to say sir of his honesty, he ha’s euerie
! thing that an honest man should not haue; what an
! honest man should haue, he has nothing
! Cap.G. I begin to loue him for this
! Ber. For this description of thine honestie? A pox
! vpon him for me, he’s more and more a Cat
! Int. What say you to his expertnesse in warre?
! Par. Faith sir, ha’s led the drumme before the English
! Tragedians: to belye him I will not, and more of his
! souldiership I know not, except in that Country, he had
! the honour to be the Officer at a place there called Mile-end,
! to instruct for the doubling of files. I would doe the
! man what honour I can, but of this I am not certaine
! Cap.G. He hath out-villain’d villanie so farre, that the
! raritie redeemes him
! Ber. A pox on him, he’s a Cat still
! Int. His qualities being at this poore price, I neede
! not to aske you, if Gold will corrupt him to reuolt
! Par. Sir, for a Cardceue he will sell the fee-simple of
! his saluation, the inheritance of it, and cut th’ intaile from
! all remainders, and a perpetuall succession for it perpetually
! Int. What’s his Brother, the other Captain Dumain?
! Cap.E. Why do’s he aske him of me?
! Int. What’s he?
! Par. E’ne a Crow a’th same nest: not altogether so
! great as the first in goodnesse, but greater a great deale in
! euill. He excels his Brother for a coward, yet his Brother
! is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreate hee outrunnes
! any Lackey; marrie in comming on, hee ha’s the
! Crampe
! Int. If your life be saued, will you vndertake to betray
! the Florentine
! Par. I, and the Captaine of his horse, Count Rossillion
! Int. Ile whisper with the Generall, and knowe his
! pleasure
! Par. Ile no more drumming, a plague of all drummes,
! onely to seeme to deserue well, and to beguile the supposition
! of that lasciuious yong boy the Count, haue I run
! into this danger: yet who would haue suspected an ambush
! where I was taken?
! Int. There is no remedy sir, but you must dye: the
! Generall sayes, you that haue so traitorously discouerd
! the secrets of your army, and made such pestifferous reports
! of men very nobly held, can serue the world for
! no honest vse: therefore you must dye. Come headesman,
! off with his head
! Par. O Lord sir let me liue, or let me see my death
! Int. That shall you, and take your leaue of all your
! friends:
! So, looke about you, know you any heere?
! Count. Good morrow noble Captaine
! Lo.E. God blesse you Captaine Parolles
! Cap.G. God saue you noble Captaine
! Lo.E. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord
! Lafew? I am for France
! Cap.G. Good Captaine will you giue me a Copy of
! the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalfe of the Count
! Rossillion, and I were not a verie Coward, I’de compell
! it of you, but far you well.
! Exeunt.
! Int. You are vndone Captaine all but your scarfe,
! that has a knot on’t yet
! Par. Who cannot be crush’d with a plot?
! Inter. If you could finde out a Countrie where but
! women were that had receiued so much shame, you
! might begin an impudent Nation. Fare yee well sir, I
! am for France too, we shall speake of you there.
! Exit
! Par. Yet am I thankfull: if my heart were great
! ‘Twould burst at this: Captaine Ile be no more,
! But I will eate, and drinke, and sleepe as soft
! As Captaine shall. Simply the thing I am
! Shall make me liue: who knowes himselfe a braggart
! Let him feare this; for it will come to passe,
! That euery braggart shall be found an Asse.
! Rust sword, coole blushes, and Parrolles liue
! Safest in shame: being fool’d, by fool’rie thriue;
! There’s place and meanes for euery man aliue.
! Ile after them.
! Enter.
! Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana.
! Hel. That you may well perceiue I haue not
! wrong’d you,
  One of the greatest in the Christian world
! Shall be my suretie: for whose throne ‘tis needfull
! Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneele.
! Time was, I did him a desired office
! Deere almost as his life, which gratitude
! Through flintie Tartars bosome would peepe forth,
! And answer thankes. I duly am inform’d,
! His grace is at Marcellae, to which place
! We haue conuenient conuoy: you must know
! I am supposed dead, the Army breaking,
! My husband hies him home, where heauen ayding,
! And by the leaue of my good Lord the King,
! Wee’l be before our welcome
! Wid. Gentle Madam,
! You neuer had a seruant to whose trust
! Your busines was more welcome
! Hel. Nor your Mistris
! Euer a friend, whose thoughts more truly labour
! To recompence your loue: Doubt not but heauen
! Hath brought me vp to be your daughters dower,
! As it hath fated her to be my motiue
! And helper to a husband. But O strange men,
! That can such sweet vse make of what they hate,
! When sawcie trusting of the cosin’d thoughts
! Defiles the pitchy night, so lust doth play
! With what it loathes, for that which is away,
! But more of this heereafter: you Diana,
! Vnder my poore instructions yet must suffer
! Something in my behalfe
! Dia. Let death and honestie
  Go with your impositions, I am yours
! Vpon your will to suffer
! Hel. Yet I pray you:
  But with the word the time will bring on summer,
! When Briars shall haue leaues as well as thornes,
! And be as sweet as sharpe: we must away,
! Our Wagon is prepar’d, and time reuiues vs,
! All’s well that ends well, still the fines the Crowne;
! What ere the course, the end is the renowne.
! Exeunt.
! Enter Clowne, old Lady, and Lafew.
! Laf. No, no, no, your sonne was misled with a snipt
! taffata fellow there, whose villanous saffron wold haue
! made all the vnbak’d and dowy youth of a nation in his
! colour: your daughter-in-law had beene aliue at this
! houre, and your sonne heere at home, more aduanc’d
! by the King, then by that red-tail’d humble Bee I speak
! of
! La. I would I had not knowne him, it was the death
! of the most vertuous gentlewoman, that euer Nature
! had praise for creating. If she had pertaken of my flesh
! and cost mee the deerest groanes of a mother, I could
! not haue owed her a more rooted loue
! Laf. Twas a good Lady, ‘twas a good Lady. Wee
! may picke a thousand sallets ere wee light on such another
! hearbe
! Clo. Indeed sir she was the sweete Margerom of the
! sallet, or rather the hearbe of grace
! Laf. They are not hearbes you knaue, they are nose-hearbes
! Clowne. I am no great Nabuchadnezar sir, I haue not
! much skill in grace
! Laf. Whether doest thou professe thy selfe, a knaue
! or a foole?
! Clo. A foole sir at a womans seruice, and a knaue at a
! mans
! Laf. Your distinction
! Clo. I would cousen the man of his wife, and do his
! seruice
! Laf. So you were a knaue at his seruice indeed
! Clo. And I would giue his wife my bauble sir to doe
! her seruice
! Laf. I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knaue
! and foole
! Clo. At your seruice
! Laf. No, no, no
! Clo. Why sir, if I cannot serue you, I can serue as
! great a prince as you are
! Laf. Whose that, a Frenchman?
! Clo. Faith sir a has an English maine, but his fisnomie
! is more hotter in France then there
! Laf. What prince is that?
! Clo. The blacke prince sir, alias the prince of darkenesse,
! alias the diuell
! Laf. Hold thee there’s my purse, I giue thee not this
! to suggest thee from thy master thou talk’st off, serue
! him still
! Clo. I am a woodland fellow sir, that alwaies loued
! a great fire, and the master I speak of euer keeps a good
! fire, but sure he is the Prince of the world, let his Nobilitie
! remaine in’s Court. I am for the house with the
! narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pompe to
! enter: some that humble themselues may, but the manie
! will be too chill and tender, and theyle bee for the
! flowrie way that leads to the broad gate, and the great
! fire
! Laf. Go thy waies, I begin to bee a wearie of thee,
! and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
! with thee. Go thy wayes, let my horses be wel look’d
! too, without any trickes
! Clo. If I put any trickes vpon em sir, they shall bee
! Iades trickes, which are their owne right by the law of
! Nature.
! Exit
! Laf. A shrewd knaue and an vnhappie
! Lady. So a is. My Lord that’s gone made himselfe
! much sport out of him, by his authoritie hee remaines
! heere, which he thinkes is a pattent for his sawcinesse,
! and indeede he has no pace, but runnes where he will
! Laf. I like him well, ‘tis not amisse: and I was about
! to tell you, since I heard of the good Ladies death, and
! that my Lord your sonne was vpon his returne home. I
! moued the King my master to speake in the behalfe of
! my daughter, which in the minoritie of them both, his
! Maiestie out of a selfe gracious remembrance did first
! propose, his Highnesse hath promis’d me to doe it, and
! to stoppe vp the displeasure he hath conceiued against
! your sonne, there is no fitter matter. How do’s your
! Ladyship like it?
! La. With verie much content my Lord, and I wish
! it happily effected
! Laf. His Highnesse comes post from Marcellus, of as
! able bodie as when he number’d thirty, a will be heere
! to morrow, or I am deceiu’d by him that in such intelligence
! hath seldome fail’d
! La. It reioyces me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
! die. I haue letters that my sonne will be heere to night:
! I shall beseech your Lordship to remaine with mee, till
! they meete together
! Laf. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I
! might safely be admitted
! Lad. You neede but pleade your honourable priuiledge
! Laf. Ladie, of that I haue made a bold charter, but
! I thanke my God, it holds yet.
! Enter Clowne.
! Clo. O Madam, yonders my Lord your sonne with
! a patch of veluet on’s face, whether there bee a scar vnder’t
! or no, the Veluet knowes, but ‘tis a goodly patch
! of Veluet, his left cheeke is a cheeke of two pile and a
! halfe, but his right cheeke is worne bare
! Laf. A scarre nobly got,
! Or a noble scarre, is a good liu’rie of honor,
! So belike is that
! Clo. But it is your carbinado’d face
! Laf. Let vs go see
! your sonne I pray you, I long to talke
! With the yong noble souldier
! Clowne. ‘Faith there’s a dozen of em, with delicate
! fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the
! head, and nod at euerie man.
! Exeunt.
! Actus Quintus.
! Enter Hellen, Widdow, and Diana, with two Attendants.
! Hel. But this exceeding posting day and night,
! Must wear your spirits low, we cannot helpe it:
! But since you haue made the daies and nights as one,
! To weare your gentle limbes in my affayres,
! Be bold you do so grow in my requitall,
! As nothing can vnroote you. In happie time,
! Enter a gentle Astringer.
! This man may helpe me to his Maiesties eare,
! If he would spend his power. God saue you sir
! Gent. And you
! Hel. Sir, I haue seene you in the Court of France
! Gent. I haue beene sometimes there
! Hel. I do presume sir, that you are not falne
! From the report that goes vpon your goodnesse,
! And therefore goaded with most sharpe occasions,
  Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
! The vse of your owne vertues, for the which
! I shall continue thankefull
! Gent. What’s your will?
! Hel. That it will please you
! To giue this poore petition to the King,
! And ayde me with that store of power you haue
! To come into his presence
! Gen. The Kings not heere
! Hel. Not heere sir?
! Gen. Not indeed,
! He hence remou’d last night, and with more hast
! Then is his vse
! Wid. Lord how we loose our paines
! Hel. All’s well that ends well yet,
! Though time seeme so aduerse, and meanes vnfit:
  I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
! Gent. Marrie as I take it to Rossillion,
! Whither I am going
! Hel. I do beseech you sir,
! Since you are like to see the King before me,
  Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
! Which I presume shall render you no blame,
! But rather make you thanke your paines for it,
! I will come after you with what good speede
! Our meanes will make vs meanes
! Gent. This Ile do for you
! Hel. And you shall finde your selfe to be well thankt
! what e’re falles more. We must to horse againe, Go, go,
! prouide.
! Enter Clowne and Parrolles.
! Par. Good Mr Lauatch giue my Lord Lafew this letter,
! I haue ere now sir beene better knowne to you, when
! I haue held familiaritie with fresher cloathes: but I am
! now sir muddied in fortunes mood, and smell somewhat
! strong of her strong displeasure
! Clo. Truely, Fortunes displeasure is but sluttish if it
! smell so strongly as thou speak’st of: I will hencefoorth
! eate no Fish of Fortunes butt’ring. Prethee alow the
! winde
! Par. Nay you neede not to stop your nose sir: I spake
! but by a Metaphor
! Clo. Indeed sir, if your Metaphor stinke, I will stop
! my nose, or against any mans Metaphor. Prethe get thee
! further
! Par. Pray you sir deliuer me this paper
! Clo. Foh, prethee stand away: a paper from fortunes
! close-stoole, to giue to a Nobleman. Looke heere he
! comes himselfe.
! Enter Lafew.
! Clo. Heere is a purre of Fortunes sir, or of Fortunes
! Cat, but not a Muscat, that ha’s falne into the vncleane
! fish-pond of her displeasure, and as he sayes is muddied
! withall. Pray you sir, vse the Carpe as you may, for he
! lookes like a poore decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally
! knaue. I doe pittie his distresse in my smiles of comfort,
! and leaue him to your Lordship
! Par. My Lord I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
! scratch’d
! Laf. And what would you haue me to doe? ‘Tis too
! late to paire her nailes now. Wherein haue you played
! the knaue with fortune that she should scratch you, who
! of her selfe is a good Lady, and would not haue knaues
! thriue long vnder? There’s a Cardecue for you: Let the
! Iustices make you and fortune friends; I am for other
! businesse
! Par. I beseech your honour to heare mee one single
! word,
! Laf. you begge a single peny more: Come you shall
! ha’t, saue your word
! Par. My name my good Lord is Parrolles
! Laf. You begge more then word then. Cox my passion,
! giue me your hand: How does your drumme?
! Par. O my good Lord, you were the first that found
! mee
! Laf. Was I insooth? And I was the first that lost thee
! Par. It lies in you my Lord to bring me in some grace
! for you did bring me out
! Laf. Out vpon thee knaue, doest thou put vpon mee
! at once both the office of God and the diuel: one brings
! thee in grace, and the other brings thee out. The Kings
! comming I know by his Trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further
! after me, I had talke of you last night, though you
! are a foole and a knaue, you shall eate, go too, follow
! Par. I praise God for you.
! Flourish. Enter King, old Lady, Lafew, the two French Lords, with
! attendants.
! Kin. We lost a Iewell of her, and our esteeme
! Was made much poorer by it: but your sonne,
! As mad in folly, lack’d the sence to know
! Her estimation home
! Old La. ‘Tis past my Liege,
! And I beseech your Maiestie to make it
! Naturall rebellion, done i’th blade of youth,
! When oyle and fire, too strong for reasons force,
! Ore-beares it, and burnes on
! Kin. My honour’d Lady,
! I haue forgiuen and forgotten all,
! Though my reuenges were high bent vpon him,
! And watch’d the time to shoote
! Laf. This I must say,
! But first I begge my pardon: the yong Lord
! Did to his Maiesty, his Mother, and his Ladie,
! Offence of mighty note; but to himselfe
! The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife,
! Whose beauty did astonish the suruey
! Of richest eies: whose words all eares tooke captiue,
! Whose deere perfection, hearts that scorn’d to serue,
! Humbly call’d Mistris
! Kin. Praising what is lost,
! Makes the remembrance deere. Well, call him hither,
! We are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill
! All repetition: Let him not aske our pardon,
  The nature of his great offence is dead,
! And deeper then obliuion, we do burie
! Th’ incensing reliques of it. Let him approach
! A stranger, no offender; and informe him
! So ‘tis our will he should
! Gent. I shall my Liege
! Kin. What sayes he to your daughter,
! Haue you spoke?
! Laf. All that he is, hath reference to your Highnes
! Kin. Then shall we haue a match. I haue letters sent
! me, that sets him high in fame.
! Enter Count Bertram.
! Laf. He lookes well on’t
! Kin. I am not a day of season,
! For thou maist see a sun-shine, and a haile
! In me at once: But to the brightest beames
! Distracted clouds giue way, so stand thou forth,
! The time is faire againe
! Ber. My high repented blames
! Deere Soueraigne pardon to me
! Kin. All is whole,
! Not one word more of the consumed time,
! Let’s take the instant by the forward top:
  For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees
! Th’ inaudible, and noiselesse foot of time
! Steales, ere we can effect them. You remember
! The daughter of this Lord?
! Ber. Admiringly my Liege, at first
! I stucke my choice vpon her, ere my heart
! Durst make too bold a herauld of my tongue:
! Where the impression of mine eye enfixing,
! Contempt his scornfull Perspectiue did lend me,
! Which warpt the line, of euerie other fauour,
! Scorn’d a faire colour, or exprest it stolne,
  Extended or contracted all proportions
! To a most hideous obiect. Thence it came,
! That she whom all men prais’d, and whom my selfe,
! Since I haue lost, haue lou’d; was in mine eye
! The dust that did offend it
! Kin. Well excus’d:
! That thou didst loue her, strikes some scores away
! From the great compt: but loue that comes too late,
! Like a remorsefull pardon slowly carried
! To the great sender, turnes a sowre offence,
! Crying, that’s good that’s gone: Our rash faults,
! Make triuiall price of serious things we haue,
! Not knowing them, vntill we know their graue.
! Oft our displeasures to our selues vniust,
! Destroy our friends, and after weepe their dust:
! Our owne loue waking, cries to see what’s done,
! While shamefull hate sleepes out the afternoone.
! Be this sweet Helens knell, and now forget her.
! Send forth your amorous token for faire Maudlin,
! The maine consents are had, and heere wee’l stay
! To see our widdowers second marriage day:
! Which better then the first, O deere heauen blesse,
! Or, ere they meete in me, O Nature cesse
! Laf. Come on my sonne, in whom my houses name
! Must be digested: giue a fauour from you
  To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
! That she may quickly come. By my old beard,
! And eu’rie haire that’s on’t, Helen that’s dead
  Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
! The last that ere I tooke her leaue at Court,
! I saw vpon her finger
! Ber. Hers it was not
! King. Now pray you let me see it. For mine eye,
! While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d too’t:
! This Ring was mine, and when I gaue it Hellen,
! I bad her if her fortunes euer stoode
! Necessitied to helpe, that by this token
! I would releeue her. Had you that craft to reaue her
  Of what should stead her most?
! Ber. My gracious Soueraigne,
! How ere it pleases you to take it so,
! The ring was neuer hers
! Old La. Sonne, on my life
! I haue seene her weare it, and she reckon’d it
! At her liues rate
! Laf. I am sure I saw her weare it
! Ber. You are deceiu’d my Lord, she neuer saw it:
! In Florence was it from a casement throwne mee,
! Wrap’d in a paper, which contain’d the name
! Of her that threw it: Noble she was, and thought
! I stood ingag’d, but when I had subscrib’d
! To mine owne fortune, and inform’d her fully,
! I could not answer in that course of Honour
! As she had made the ouerture, she ceast
! In heauie satisfaction, and would neuer
! Receiue the Ring againe
! Kin. Platus himselfe,
! That knowes the tinct and multiplying med’cine,
! Hath not in natures mysterie more science,
! Then I haue in this Ring. ‘Twas mine, ‘twas Helens,
! Who euer gaue it you: then if you know
! That you are well acquainted with your selfe,
! Confesse ‘twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
! You got it from her. She call’d the Saints to suretie,
! That she would neuer put it from her finger,
! Vnlesse she gaue it to your selfe in bed,
! Where you haue neuer come: or sent it vs
! Vpon her great disaster
! Ber. She neuer saw it
! Kin. Thou speak’st it falsely: as I loue mine Honor,
! And mak’st connecturall feares to come into me,
! Which I would faine shut out, if it should proue
! That thou art so inhumane, ‘twill not proue so:
! And yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly,
! And she is dead, which nothing but to close
! Her eyes my selfe, could win me to beleeue,
! More then to see this Ring. Take him away,
! My fore-past proofes, how ere the matter fall
! Shall taze my feares of little vanitie,
! Hauing vainly fear’d too little. Away with him,
! Wee’l sift this matter further
! Ber. If you shall proue
! This Ring was euer hers, you shall as easie
! Proue that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
! Where yet she neuer was.
! Enter a Gentleman.
! King. I am wrap’d in dismall thinkings
! Gen. Gracious Soueraigne.
! Whether I haue beene too blame or no, I know not,
  Here’s a petition from a Florentine,
! Who hath for foure or fiue remoues come short,
! To tender it her selfe. I vndertooke it,
! Vanquish’d thereto by the faire grace and speech
! Of the poore suppliant, who by this I know
! Is heere attending: her businesse lookes in her
! With an importing visage, and she told me
! In a sweet verball breefe, it did concerne
! Your Highnesse with her selfe.
! A Letter.
! Vpon his many protestations to marrie mee when his wife was
! dead, I blush to say it, he wonne me. Now is the Count Rossillion
! a Widdower, his vowes are forfeited to mee, and my
! honors payed to him. Hee stole from Florence, taking no
! leaue, and I follow him to his Countrey for Iustice: Grant
! it me, O King, in you it best lies, otherwise a seducer flourishes,
! and a poore Maid is vndone.
! Diana Capilet
! Laf. I will buy me a sonne in Law in a faire, and toule
! for this. Ile none of him
! Kin. The heauens haue thought well on thee Lafew,
! To bring forth this discou’rie, seeke these sutors:
! Go speedily, and bring againe the Count.
! Enter Bertram.
! I am a-feard the life of Hellen (Ladie)
! Was fowly snatcht
! Old La. Now iustice on the doers
! King. I wonder sir, sir, wiues are monsters to you,
! And that you flye them as you sweare them Lordship,
! Yet you desire to marry. What woman’s that?
! Enter Widdow, Diana, and Parrolles.
! Dia. I am my Lord a wretched Florentine,
! Deriued from the ancient Capilet,
! My suite as I do vnderstand you know,
! And therefore know how farre I may be pittied
! Wid. I am her Mother sir, whose age and honour
! Both suffer vnder this complaint we bring,
! And both shall cease, without your remedie
! King. Come hether Count, do you know these Women?
! Ber. My Lord, I neither can nor will denie,
! But that I know them, do they charge me further?
! Dia. Why do you looke so strange vpon your wife?
! Ber. She’s none of mine my Lord
! Dia. If you shall marrie
! You giue away this hand, and that is mine,
! You giue away heauens vowes, and those are mine:
! You giue away my selfe, which is knowne mine:
  For I by vow am so embodied yours,
! That she which marries you, must marrie me,
! Either both or none
! Laf. Your reputation comes too short for my daughter,
! you are no husband for her
! Ber. My Lord, this is a fond and desp’rate creature,
! Whom sometime I haue laugh’d with: Let your highnes
! Lay a more noble thought vpon mine honour,
! Then for to thinke that I would sinke it heere
! Kin. Sir for my thoughts, you haue them il to friend,
! Till your deeds gaine them fairer: proue your honor,
! Then in my thought it lies
! Dian. Good my Lord,
! Aske him vpon his oath, if hee do’s thinke
! He had not my virginity
! Kin. What saist thou to her?
! Ber. She’s impudent my Lord,
! And was a common gamester to the Campe
! Dia. He do’s me wrong my Lord: If I were so,
! He might haue bought me at a common price.
! Do not beleeue him. O behold this Ring,
! Whose high respect and rich validitie
! Did lacke a Paralell: yet for all that
! He gaue it to a Commoner a’th Campe
! If I be one
! Coun. He blushes, and ‘tis hit:
! Of sixe preceding Ancestors that Iemme
! Confer’d by testament to’th sequent issue
! Hath it beene owed and worne. This is his wife,
! That Ring’s a thousand proofes
! King. Me thought you saide
! You saw one heere in Court could witnesse it
! Dia. I did my Lord, but loath am to produce
! So bad an instrument, his names Parrolles
! Laf. I saw the man to day, if man he bee
! Kin. Finde him, and bring him hether
! Ros. What of him:
! He’s quoted for a most perfidious slaue
! With all the spots a’th world, taxt and debosh’d,
! Whose nature sickens: but to speake a truth,
! Am I, or that or this for what he’l vtter,
! That will speake any thing
! Kin. She hath that Ring of yours
! Ros. I thinke she has; certaine it is I lyk’d her,
! And boorded her i’th wanton way of youth:
! She knew her distance, and did angle for mee,
! Madding my eagernesse with her restraint,
! As all impediments in fancies course
! Are motiues of more fancie, and in fine,
! Her insuite comming with her moderne grace,
! Subdu’d me to her rate, she got the Ring,
! And I had that which any inferiour might
! At Market price haue bought
! Dia. I must be patient:
! You that haue turn’d off a first so noble wife,
! May iustly dyet me. I pray you yet,
! (Since you lacke vertue, I will loose a husband)
! Send for your Ring, I will returne it home,
! And giue me mine againe
! Ros. I haue it not
! Kin. What Ring was yours I pray you?
! Dian. Sir much like the same vpon your finger
! Kin. Know you this Ring, this Ring was his of late
! Dia. And this was it I gaue him being a bed
! Kin. The story then goes false, you threw it him
! Out of a Casement
! Dia. I haue spoke the truth.
! Enter Parolles.
! Ros. My Lord, I do confesse the ring was hers
! Kin. You boggle shrewdly, euery feather starts you:
! Is this the man you speake of?
! Dia. I, my Lord
! Kin. Tell me sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,
! Not fearing the displeasure of your master:
! Which on your iust proceeding, Ile keepe off,
! By him and by this woman heere, what know you?
! Par. So please your Maiesty, my master hath bin an
! honourable Gentleman. Trickes hee hath had in him,
! which Gentlemen haue
! Kin. Come, come, to’th’ purpose: Did hee loue this
! woman?
! Par. Faith sir he did loue her, but how
! Kin. How I pray you?
! Par. He did loue her sir, as a Gent. loues a Woman
! Kin. How is that?
! Par. He lou’d her sir, and lou’d her not
! Kin. As thou art a knaue and no knaue, what an equiuocall
! Companion is this?
! Par. I am a poore man, and at your Maiesties command
! Laf. Hee’s a good drumme my Lord, but a naughtie
! Orator
! Dian. Do you know he promist me marriage?
! Par. Faith I know more then Ile speake
! Kin. But wilt thou not speake all thou know’st?
! Par. Yes so please your Maiesty: I did goe betweene
! them as I said, but more then that he loued her, for indeede
! he was madde for her, and talkt of Sathan, and of
! Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in
! that credit with them at that time, that I knewe of their
! going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her
! marriage, and things which would deriue mee ill will to
! speake of, therefore I will not speake what I know
! Kin. Thou hast spoken all alreadie, vnlesse thou canst
! say they are maried, but thou art too fine in thy euidence,
! therefore stand aside. This Ring you say was yours
! Dia. I my good Lord
! Kin. Where did you buy it? Or who gaue it you?
! Dia. It was not giuen me, nor I did not buy it
! Kin. Who lent it you?
! Dia. It was not lent me neither
! Kin. Where did you finde it then?
! Dia. I found it not
! Kin. If it were yours by none of all these wayes,
! How could you giue it him?
! Dia. I neuer gaue it him
! Laf. This womans an easie gloue my Lord, she goes
! off and on at pleasure
! Kin. This Ring was mine, I gaue it his first wife
! Dia. It might be yours or hers for ought I know
! Kin. Take her away, I do not like her now,
! To prison with her: and away with him,
! Vnlesse thou telst me where thou hadst this Ring,
! Thou diest within this houre
! Dia. Ile neuer tell you
! Kin. Take her away
! Dia. Ile put in baile my liedge
! Kin. I thinke thee now some common Customer
! Dia. By Ioue if euer I knew man ‘twas you
! King. Wherefore hast thou accusde him al this while
! Dia. Because he’s guiltie, and he is not guilty:
! He knowes I am no Maid, and hee’l sweare too’t:
! Ile sweare I am a Maid, and he knowes not.
! Great King I am no strumpet, by my life,
! I am either Maid, or else this old mans wife
! Kin. She does abuse our eares, to prison with her
! Dia. Good mother fetch my bayle. Stay Royall sir,
! The Ieweller that owes the Ring is sent for,
! And he shall surety me. But for this Lord,
! Who hath abus’d me as he knowes himselfe,
! Though yet he neuer harm’d me, heere I quit him.
! He knowes himselfe my bed he hath defil’d,
! And at that time he got his wife with childe:
! Dead though she be, she feeles her yong one kicke:
! So there’s my riddle, one that’s dead is quicke,
  And now behold the meaning.
! Enter Hellen and Widdow.
! Kin. Is there no exorcist
! Beguiles the truer Office of mine eyes?
! Is’t reall that I see?
! Hel. No my good Lord,
  ‘Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
! The name, and not the thing
! Ros. Both, both, O pardon
! Hel. Oh my good Lord, when I was like this Maid,
! I found you wondrous kinde, there is your Ring,
! And looke you, heeres your letter: this it sayes,
! When from my finger you can get this Ring,
! And is by me with childe, &c. This is done,
! Will you be mine now you are doubly wonne?
! Ros. If she my Liege can make me know this clearly,
! Ile loue her dearely, euer, euer dearly
! Hel. If it appeare not plaine, and proue vntrue,
! Deadly diuorce step betweene me and you.
! O my deere mother do I see you liuing?
! Laf. Mine eyes smell Onions, I shall weepe anon:
! Good Tom Drumme lend me a handkercher.
! So I thanke thee, waite on me home, Ile make sport with
! thee: Let thy curtsies alone, they are scuruy ones
! King. Let vs from point to point this storie know,
! To make the euen truth in pleasure flow:
! If thou beest yet a fresh vncropped flower,
! Choose thou thy husband, and Ile pay thy dower.
! For I can guesse, that by thy honest ayde,
! Thou keptst a wife her selfe, thy selfe a Maide.
! Of that and all the progresse more and lesse,
! Resoluedly more leasure shall expresse:
! All yet seemes well, and if it end so meete,
  The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
! Flourish.
! The Kings a Begger, now the Play is done,
! All is well ended, if this suite be wonne,
! That you expresse Content: which we will pay,
  With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
! Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts,
! Your gentle hands lend vs, and take our hearts.
! Exeunt. omn.
! FINIS. ALL’S Well, that Ends Well.
